<h1 title="">THE SHADOW</h1>
<h2 id="c1">I</h2>
<p>Blake, the Second Deputy, raised his
gloomy hound&rsquo;s eyes as the door opened
and a woman stepped in. Then he dropped
them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Elsie!&rdquo; he said, without looking at
her.</p>
<p>The woman stood a moment staring at him.
Then she advanced thoughtfully toward his
table desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jim!&rdquo; she answered, as she sank into
the empty chair at the desk end. The rustling
of silk suddenly ceased. An aphrodisiac
odor of ambergris crept through the Deputy-Commissioner&rsquo;s
office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>The woman looped up her veil, festooning
it about the undulatory roll of her hat brim.
Blake continued his solemnly preoccupied
study of the desk top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sent for me,&rdquo; the woman finally said.
It was more a reminder than a question. And
the voice, for all its quietness, carried no sense
of timidity. The woman&rsquo;s pale face, where
the undulating hat brim left the shadowy eyes
still more shadowy, seemed fortified with a
calm sense of power. It was something more
than a dormant consciousness of beauty,
though the knowledge that men would turn
back to a face so wistful as hers, and their
judgment could be dulled by a smile so narcotizing,
had not a little to do with the woman&rsquo;s
achieved serenity. There was nothing outwardly
sinister about her. This fact had always
left her doubly dangerous as a law-breaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>Blake himself, for all his dewlap and his
two hundred pounds of lethargic beefiness, felt
a vague and inward stirring as he finally lifted
his head and looked at her. He looked into
the shadowy eyes under the level brows. He
could see, as he had seen before, that they were
exceptional eyes, with iris rings of deep gray
about the ever-widening and ever-narrowing
pupils which varied with varying thought, as
though set too close to the brain that controlled
them. So dominating was this pupil that
sometimes the whole eye looked violet, and
sometimes green, according to the light.</p>
<p>Then his glance strayed to the woman&rsquo;s
mouth, where the upper lip curved outward,
from the base of the straight nose, giving her
at first glance the appearance of pouting.
Yet the heavier underlip, soft and wilful, contradicted
this impression of peevishness, deepened
it into one of Ishmael-like rebellion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Then Blake looked at the woman&rsquo;s hair. It
was abundant and nut-brown, and artfully and
scrupulously interwoven and twisted together.
It seemed to stand the solitary pride of a life
claiming few things of which to be proud.
Blake remembered how that wealth of nut-brown
hair was daily plaited and treasured
and coiled and cared for, the meticulous attentiveness
with which morning by morning
its hip-reaching abundance was braided and
twisted and built up about the small head, an
intricate structure of soft wonder which midnight
must ever see again in ruins, just as the
next morning would find idly laborious fingers
rebuilding its ephemeral glories. This rebuilding
was done thoughtfully and calmly, as
though it were a religious rite, as though it
were a sacrificial devotion to an ideal in a life
tragically forlorn of beauty.</p>
<p>He remembered, too, the day when he had
first seen her. That was at the time of &ldquo;The
Sick Millionaire&rdquo; case, when he had first
learned of her association with Binhart. She
had posed at the Waldorf as a trained nurse,
in that case, and had met him and held him off
and outwitted him at every turn. Then he
had decided on his &ldquo;plant.&rdquo; To effect this he
had whisked a young Italian with a lacerated
thumb up from the City Hospital and sent
him in to her as an injured elevator-boy looking
for first-aid treatment. One glimpse of
her work on that thumb showed her to be betrayingly
ignorant of both figure-of-eight and
spica bandaging, and Blake, finally satisfied as
to the imposture, carried on his investigation,
showed &ldquo;Doctor Callahan&rdquo; to be Connie Binhart,
the con-man and bank thief, and sent the
two adventurers scurrying away to shelter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>He remembered, too, how seven months after
that first meeting Stimson of the Central
Office had brought her to Headquarters, fresh
from Paris, involved in some undecipherable
way in an Aix-les-Bains diamond robbery.
The despatches had given his office very little
to work on, and she had smiled at his thunderous
grillings and defied his noisy threats. But
as she sat there before him, chic and guarded,
with her girlishly frail body so arrogantly well
gowned, she had in some way touched his
lethargic imagination. She showed herself to
be of finer and keener fiber than the sordid
demireps with whom he had to do. Shimmering
and saucy and debonair as a polo pony,
she had seemed a departure from type, something
above the meretricious termagants round
whom he so often had to weave his accusatory
webs of evidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Then, the following autumn, she was still
again mysteriously involved in the Sheldon
wire-tapping coup. This Montreal banker
named Sheldon, from whom nearly two hundred
thousand dollars had been wrested, put
a bullet through his head rather than go home
disgraced, and she had straightway been
brought down to Blake, for, until the autopsy
and the production of her dupe&rsquo;s letters, Sheldon&rsquo;s
death had been looked upon as a murder.</p>
<p>Blake had locked himself in with the white-faced
Miss Elsie Verriner, alias Chaddy Cravath,
alias Charlotte Carruthers, and for three
long hours he had pitted his dynamic brute
force against her flashing and snake-like evasiveness.
He had pounded her with the artillery
of his inhumanities. He had beleaguered
her with explosive brutishness. He had bulldozed
and harried her into frantic weariness.
He had third-degreed her into cowering and
trembling indignation, into hectic mental uncertainties.
Then, with the fatigue point well
passed, he had marshaled the last of his own
animal strength and essayed the final blasphemous
Vesuvian onslaught that brought about
the nervous breakdown, the ultimate collapse.
She had wept, then, the blubbering, loose-lipped,
abandoned weeping of hysteria. She
had stumbled forward and caught at his arm
and clung to it, as though it were her last
earthly pillar of support. Her huge plaited
ropes of hair had fallen down, thick brown
ropes longer than his own arms, and he,
breathing hard, had sat back and watched
them as she wept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>But Blake was neither analytical nor introspective.
How it came about he never quite
knew. He felt, after his blind and inarticulate
fashion, that this scene of theirs, that this
official assault and surrender, was in some way
associated with the climacteric transports of
camp-meeting evangelism, that it involved
strange nerve-centers touched on in rhapsodic
religions, that it might even resemble the final
emotional surrender of reluctant love itself to
the first aggressive tides of passion. What it
was based on, what it arose from, he could not
say. But in the flood-tide of his own tumultuous
conquest he had watched her abandoned
weeping and her tumbled brown hair. And
as he watched, a vague and troubling tingle
sped like a fuse-sputter along his limbs, and
fired something dormant and dangerous in the
great hulk of a body which had never before
been stirred by its explosion of emotion. It
was not pity, he knew; for pity was something
quite foreign to his nature. Yet as she lay
back, limp and forlorn against his shoulder,
sobbing weakly out that she wanted to be a
good woman, that she could be honest if they
would only give her a chance, he felt that thus
to hold her, to shield her, was something desirable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>She had stared, weary and wide-eyed, as his
head had bent closer down over hers. She had
drooped back, bewildered and unresponsive, as
his heavy lips had closed on hers that were still
wet and salty with tears. When she had left
the office, at the end of that strange hour, she
had gone with the promise of his protection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>The sobering light of day, with its cynic relapse
to actualities, might have left that promise
a worthless one, had not the prompt evidence
of Sheldon&rsquo;s suicide come to hand.
This made Blake&rsquo;s task easier than he had expected.
The movement against Elsie Verriner
was &ldquo;smothered&rdquo; at Headquarters.
Two days later she met Blake by appointment.
That day, for the first time in his life,
he gave flowers to a woman.</p>
<p>Two weeks later he startled her with the
declaration that he wanted to marry her. He
didn&rsquo;t care about her past. She&rsquo;d been
dragged into the things she&rsquo;d done without
understanding them, at first, and she&rsquo;d kept
on because there&rsquo;d been no one to help her
away from them. He knew he could do it.
She had a fine streak in her, and he wanted to
bring it out!</p>
<p>A little frightened, she tried to explain that
she was not the marrying kind. Then, brick-red
and bull-necked, he tried to tell her in his
groping Celtic way that he wanted children,
that she meant a lot to him, that he was going
to try to make her the happiest woman south
of Harlem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>This had brought into her face a quick and
dangerous light which he found hard to explain.
He could see that she was flattered by
what he had said, that his words had made her
waywardly happy, that for a moment, in fact,
she had been swept off her feet.</p>
<p>Then dark afterthought interposed. It
crept like a cloud across her abandoned face.
It brought about a change so prompt that it
disturbed the Second Deputy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re not tied up already, are
you?&rdquo; he had hesitatingly demanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not tied up!&rdquo; she had promptly
and fiercely responded. &ldquo;My life&rsquo;s my own&mdash;my
own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why can&rsquo;t you marry me?&rdquo; the practical-minded
man had asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could!&rdquo; she had retorted, with the same
fierceness as before. Then she had stood looking
at him out of wistful and unhappy eyes.
&ldquo;I could&mdash;if you only understood, if you could
only help me the way I want to be helped!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>She had clung to his arm with a tragic forlornness
that seemed to leave her very wan and
helpless. And he had found it ineffably
sweet to enfold that warm mass of wan helplessness
in his own virile strength.</p>
<p>She asked for time, and he was glad to consent
to the delay, so long as it did not keep
him from seeing her. In matters of the emotions
he was still as uninitiated as a child. He
found himself a little dazed by the seemingly
accidental tenderness, by the promises of devotion,
in which she proved so lavish. Morning
by jocund morning he built up his airy dreams,
as carefully as she built up her nut-brown
plaits. He grew heavily light-headed with
his plans for the future. When she pleaded
with him never to leave her, never to trust her
too much, he patted her thin cheek and asked
when she was going to name the day. From
that finality she still edged away, as though
her happiness itself were only experimental,
as though she expected the blue sky above
them to deliver itself of a bolt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>But by this time she had become a habit with
him. He liked her even in her moodiest moments.
When, one day, she suggested that
they go away together, anywhere so long as it
was away, he merely laughed at her childishness.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, Blake himself who went
away. After nine weeks of alternating suspense
and happiness that seemed nine weeks of
inebriation to him, he was called out of the
city to complete the investigation on a series of
iron-workers&rsquo; dynamite outrages. Daily he
wrote or wired back to her. But he was kept
away longer than he had expected. When he
returned to New York she was no longer there.
She had disappeared as completely as though
an asphalted avenue had opened and swallowed
her up. It was not until the following winter
that he learned she was again with Connie Binhart,
in southern Europe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>He had known his one belated love affair.
It had left no scar, he claimed, because it had
made no wound. Binhart, he consoled himself,
had held the woman in his power: there
had been no defeat because there had been no
actual conquest. And now he could face her
without an eye-blink of conscious embarrassment.
Yet it was good to remember that
Connie Binhart was going to be ground in the
wheels of the law, and ground fine, and ground
to a finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you want me for, Jim?&rdquo; the
woman was again asking him. She spoke with
an intimate directness, and yet in her attitude
were subtle reservations, a consciousness of the
thin ice on which they both stood. Each saw,
only too plainly, the need for great care, in
every step. In each lay the power to uncover,
at a hand&rsquo;s turn, old mistakes that were best
unremembered. Yet there was a certain suave
audacity about the woman. She was not really
afraid of Blake, and the Second Deputy
had to recognize that fact. This self-assurance
of hers he attributed to the recollection that
she had once brought about his personal subjugation,
&ldquo;got his goat,&rdquo; as he had phrased it.
She, woman-like, would never forget it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man I want. And Schmittenberg
tells me you know where he is.&rdquo; Blake,
as he spoke, continued to look heavily down at
his desk top.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she answered cautiously, watching
herself as carefully as an actress with a r&ocirc;le
to sustain, a r&ocirc;le in which she could never be
quite letter-perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Connie Binhart,&rdquo; cut out the Second
Deputy.</p>
<p>He could see discretion drop like a curtain
across her watching face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Connie Binhart!&rdquo; she temporized. Blake,
as his heavy side glance slewed about to her,
prided himself on the fact that he could see
through her pretenses. At any other time he
would have thrown open the flood-gates of
that ever-inundating anger of his and swept
away all such obliquities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; he went on with slow patience,
&ldquo;we know him best round here as Charles
Blanchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blanchard?&rdquo; she echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Blanchard, the Blanchard we&rsquo;ve been
looking for, for seven months now, the Blanchard
who chloroformed Ezra Newcomb and
carried off a hundred and eighteen thousand
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Newcomb?&rdquo; again meditated the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Blanchard who shot down the bank
detective in Newcomb&rsquo;s room when the rest of
the bank was listening to a German band playing
in the side street, a band hired for the
occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was that?&rdquo; demanded the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was last October,&rdquo; he answered with
a sing-song weariness suggestive of impatience
at such supererogative explanations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was at Monte Carlo all last autumn,&rdquo; was
the woman&rsquo;s quick retort.</p>
<p>Blake moved his heavy body, as though to
shoulder away any claim as to her complicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;And
you went north to Paris on the twenty-ninth
of November. And on the third of December
you went to Cherbourg; and on the ninth you
landed in New York. I know all that.
That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m after. I want to know
where Connie Binhart is, now, to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their glances at last came together. No
move was made; no word was spoken. But a
contest took place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why ask <i>me</i>?&rdquo; repeated the woman for
the second time. It was only too plain that
she was fencing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you <i>know</i>,&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s curt retort.
He let the gray-irised eyes drink in the
full cup of his determination. Some slowly
accumulating consciousness of his power
seemed to intimidate her. He could detect a
change in her bearing, in her speech itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; she slowly asserted.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;o know,&rdquo; he stubbornly maintained.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat studying him for a minute or two.
Her face had lost its earlier arrogance. It
seemed troubled; almost touched with fear.
She was not altogether ignorant, he reminded
himself, of the resources which he could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather you let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>The Second Deputy&rsquo;s smile, scoffing and
melancholy, showed how utterly he ignored
her answer. He looked at his watch. Then
he looked back at the woman. A nervous tug-of-war
was taking place between her right and
left hand, with a twisted-up pair of ecru
gloves for the cable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know me,&rdquo; he began again in his deliberate
and abdominal bass. &ldquo;And I know
you. I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;o get this man Binhart. I&rsquo;ve
got &rsquo;o! He&rsquo;s been out for seven months, now,
and they&rsquo;re going to put it up to me, to <i>me</i>,
personally. Copeland tried to get him without
me. He fell down on it. They all fell
down on it. And now they&rsquo;re going to
throw the case back on me. They think it&rsquo;ll
be my Waterloo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed. His laugh was as mirthless as
the cackle of a guinea hen. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going
to die hard, believe me! And if I go down, if
they think they can throw me on that, I&rsquo;m going
to take a few of my friends along with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a threat?&rdquo; was the woman&rsquo;s quick
inquiry. Her eyes narrowed again, for she
had long since learned, and learned it to her
sorrow, that every breath he drew was a breath
of self-interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s just a plain statement.&rdquo; He
slewed about in his swivel chair, throwing one
thick leg over the other as he did so. &ldquo;I hate
to holler Auburn at a girl like you, Elsie; but
I&rsquo;m going&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auburn?&rdquo; she repeated very quietly.
Then she raised her eyes to his. &ldquo;Can you say
a thing like that to me, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shifted a little in his chair. But he met
her gaze without a wince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is business, Elsie, and you can&rsquo;t mix
business and&mdash;and other things,&rdquo; he tailed off
at last, dropping his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you put it that way,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I hoped we&rsquo;d be better friends than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not counting on friendship in this!&rdquo;
he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it might have been better, even in
this!&rdquo; she said. And the artful look of pity
on her face angered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll begin on something nearer
home!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>He reached down into his pocket and produced
a small tinted oblong of paper. He
held it, face out, between his thumb and forefinger,
so that she could read it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Steinert check&rsquo;ll do the trick. Take
a closer look at the signature. Do you get
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; she asked, without a
tremor.</p>
<p>He restored the check to his wallet and the
wallet to his pocket. She would find it impossible
to outdo him in the matter of impassivity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may or I may not know who forged that
check. I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to know. And when
you tell me where Binhart is, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That check wasn&rsquo;t forged,&rdquo; contended the
quiet-eyed woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steinert will swear it was,&rdquo; declared the
Second Deputy.</p>
<p>She sat without speaking, apparently in
deep study. Her intent face showed no fear,
no bewilderment, no actual emotion of any
kind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;o face it,&rdquo; said Blake, sitting
back and waiting for her to speak. His attitude
was that of a physician at a bedside,
awaiting the prescribed opiate to produce its
prescribed effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I be dragged into this case, in any
way, if Binhart is rounded up?&rdquo; the woman
finally asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not once,&rdquo; he asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promise me that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered the Second Deputy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll let me alone on&mdash;on the other
things?&rdquo; she calmly exacted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he promptly acknowledged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see that you&rsquo;re let alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she looked at him with her veiled and
judicial eyes. Then she dropped her hands
into her lap. The gesture seemed one of
resignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Binhart&rsquo;s in Montreal,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Blake, keeping his face well under control,
waited for her to go on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been in Montreal for weeks now.
You&rsquo;ll find him at 381 King Edward Avenue,
in Westmount. He&rsquo;s there, posing as an expert
accountant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw the quick shadow of doubt, the eye-flash
of indecision. So she reached quietly
down and opened her pocket-book, rummaging
through its contents for a moment or two.
Then she handed Blake a folded envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know his writing?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen enough of it,&rdquo; he retorted, as he
examined the typewritten envelope postmarked
&ldquo;Montreal, Que.&rdquo; Then he drew out
the inner sheet. On it, written by pen, he read
the message: &ldquo;Come to 381 King Edward
when the coast is clear,&rdquo; and below this the
initials &ldquo;C. B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake, with the writing still before his eyes,
opened a desk drawer and took out a large
reading-glass. Through the lens of this he
again studied the inscription, word by word.
Then he turned to the office &rsquo;phone on his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nolan,&rdquo; he said into the receiver, &ldquo;I want
to know if there&rsquo;s a King Edward Avenue in
Montreal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>He sat there waiting, still regarding the
handwriting with stolidly reproving eyes.
There was no doubt of its authenticity. He
would have known it at a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; came the answer over the wire.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the newer avenues in Westmount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake, still wrapped in thought, hung up the
receiver. The woman facing him did not seem
to resent his possible imputation of dishonesty.
To be suspicious of all with whom he came in
contact was imposed on him by his profession.
He was compelled to watch even his associates,
his operatives and underlings, his friends as
well as his enemies. Life, with him, was a
<i>concerto</i> of skepticisms.</p>
<p>She was able to watch him, without emotion,
as he again bent forward, took up the &rsquo;phone
receiver, and this time spoke apparently to another
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to wire Teal to get a man out
to cover 381 King Edward Avenue, in Montreal.
Yes, Montreal. Tell him to get a man
out there inside of an hour, and put a night
watch on until I relieve &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Then, breathing heavily, he bent over his
desk, wrote a short message on a form pad and
pushed the buzzer-button with his thick finger.
He carefully folded up the piece of paper as
he waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get that off to Carpenter in Montreal
right away,&rdquo; he said to the attendant who answered
his call. Then he swung about in his
chair, with a throaty grunt of content. He
sat for a moment, staring at the woman with
unseeing eyes. Then he stood up. With his
hands thrust deep in his pockets he slowly
moved his head back and forth, as though assenting
to some unuttered question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie, you&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; he acknowledged
with his solemn and unimaginative impassivity.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her quiet gaze, with all its reservations, was
a tacit question. He was still a little puzzled
by her surrender. He knew she did not regard
him as the great man that he was, that his
public career had made of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve helped me out of a hole,&rdquo; he
acknowledged as he faced her interrogating
eyes with his one-sided smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty
glad you&rsquo;ve done it, Elsie&mdash;for your sake as
well as mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hole?&rdquo; asked the woman, wearily
drawing on her gloves. There was neither
open contempt nor indifference on her face.
Yet something in her bearing nettled him.
The quietness of her question contrasted
strangely with the gruffness of the Second
Deputy&rsquo;s voice as he answered her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they think I&rsquo;m a has-been round here,&rdquo;
he snorted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got the idea I&rsquo;m out
o&rsquo; date. And I&rsquo;m going to show &rsquo;em a thing
or two to wake &rsquo;em up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked the woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By doing what their whole kid-glove gang
haven&rsquo;t been able to do,&rdquo; he avowed. And
having delivered himself of that ultimatum,
he promptly relaxed into his old-time impassiveness,
like a dog snapping from his kennel
and shrinking back into its shadows. At the
same moment that Blake&rsquo;s thick forefinger
again prodded the buzzer-button at his desk
end the watching woman could see the relapse
into official wariness. It was as though he had
put the shutters up in front of his soul. She
accepted the movement as a signal of dismissal.
She rose from her chair and quietly lowered
and adjusted her veil. Yet through that
lowered veil she stood looking down at Never-Fail
Blake for a moment or two. She looked
at him with grave yet casual curiosity, as tourists
look at a ruin that has been pointed out to
them as historic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t give me back Connie Binhart&rsquo;s
note,&rdquo; she reminded him as she paused with
her gloved finger-tips resting on the desk edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you want it?&rdquo; he queried with simulated
indifference, as he made a final and lingering
study of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to keep it,&rdquo; she acknowledged.
When, without meeting her eyes, he handed it
over to her, she folded it and restored it to her
pocket-book, carefully, as though vast things
depended on that small scrap of paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Never-Fail Blake, alone in his office and still
assailed by the vaguely disturbing perfumes
which she had left behind her, pondered her
reasons for taking back Binhart&rsquo;s scrap of
paper. He wondered if she had at any time
actually cared for Binhart. He wondered if
she was capable of caring for anybody. And
this problem took his thoughts back to the time
when so much might have depended on its
answer.</p>
<p>The Second Deputy dropped his reading-glass
in its drawer and slammed it shut. It
made no difference, he assured himself, one
way or the other. And in the consolatory moments
of a sudden new triumph Never-Fail
Blake let his thoughts wander pleasantly back
over that long life which (and of this he was
now comfortably conscious) his next official
move was about to redeem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c2">II</h2>
<p>It was as a Milwaukee newsboy, at the age
of twelve, that &ldquo;Jimmie&rdquo; Blake first found
himself in any way associated with that arm
of constituted authority known as the police
force. A plain-clothes man, on that occasion,
had given him a two-dollar bill to carry about
an armful of evening papers and at the same
time &ldquo;tail&rdquo; an itinerant pickpocket. The
fortifying knowledge, two years later, that
the Law was behind him when he was pushed
happy and tingling through a transom to release
the door-lock for a house-detective, was
perhaps a foreshadowing of that pride which
later welled up in his bosom at the phrase that
he would always &ldquo;have United Decency behind
him,&rdquo; as the social purifiers fell into the
habit of putting it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>At nineteen, as a &ldquo;checker&rdquo; at the Upper
Kalumet Collieries, Blake had learned to remember
faces. Slavic or Magyar, Swedish or
Calabrian, from that daily line of over two
hundred he could always pick his face and correctly
call the name. His post meant a life
of indolence and petty authority. His earlier
work as a steamfitter had been more profitable.
Yet at that work he had been a menial; it involved
no transom-born thrills, no street-corner
tailer&rsquo;s suspense. As a checker he was at least
the master of other men.</p>
<p>His public career had actually begun as a
strike breaker. The monotony of night-watchman
service, followed by a year as a
drummer for an Eastern firearm firm, and another
year as an inspector for a Pennsylvania
powder factory, had infected him with the
<i>wanderlust</i> of his kind. It was in Chicago,
on a raw day of late November, with a lake
wind whipping the street dust into his eyes,
that he had seen the huge canvas sign of a
hiring agency&rsquo;s office, slapping in the storm.
This sign had said:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;MEN WANTED.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Being twenty-six and adventurous and out of
a job, he had drifted in with the rest of earth&rsquo;s
undesirables and asked for work.</p>
<p>After twenty minutes of private coaching
in the mysteries of railway signals, he had been
&ldquo;passed&rdquo; by the desk examiner and sent out
as one of the &ldquo;scab&rdquo; train crew to move perishable
freight, for the Wisconsin Central was
then in the throes of its first great strike. And
he had gone out as a green brakeman, but he
had come back as a hero, with a <i>Tribune</i> reporter
posing him against a furniture car for
a two-column photo. For the strikers had
stoned his train, half killed the &ldquo;scab&rdquo; fireman,
stalled him in the yards and cut off two thirds
of his cars and shot out the cab-windows for
full measure. But in the cab with an Irish
engine-driver named O&rsquo;Hagan, Blake had
backed down through the yards again, picked
up his train, crept up over the tender and along
the car tops, recoupled his cars, fought his way
back to the engine, and there, with the ecstatic
O&rsquo;Hagan at his side, had hurled back the last
of the strikers trying to storm his engine steps.
He even fell to &ldquo;firing&rdquo; as the yodeling
O&rsquo;Hagan got his train moving again, and then,
perched on the tender coal, took pot-shots with
his brand-new revolver at a last pair of strikers
who were attempting to manipulate the hand-brakes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>That had been the first train to get out of the
yards in seven days. Through a godlike disregard
of signals, it is true, they had run into
an open switch, some twenty-eight miles up
the line, but they had moved their freight and
won their point.</p>
<p>Blake, two weeks later, had made himself
further valuable to that hiring agency, not
above subornation of perjury, by testifying in
a court of law to the sobriety of a passenger
crew who had been carried drunk from their
scab-manned train. So na&iuml;vely dogged was he
in his stand, so quick was he in his retorts, that
the agency, when the strike ended by a compromise
ten days later, took him on as one of
their own operatives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Thus James Blake became a private detective.
He was at first disappointed in the
work. It seemed, at first, little better than his
old job as watchman and checker. But the
agency, after giving him a three-week try out
at picket work, submitted him to the further
test of a &ldquo;shadowing&rdquo; case. That first assignment
of &ldquo;tailing&rdquo; kept him thirty-six hours
without sleep, but he stuck to his trail, stuck to
it with the blind pertinacity of a bloodhound,
and at the end transcended mere animalism by
buying a tip from a friendly bartender.
Then, when the moment was ripe, he walked
into the designated hop-joint and picked his
man out of an underground bunk as impassively
as a grocer takes an egg crate from a
cellar shelf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>After his initial baptism of fire in the Wisconsin
Central railway yards, however, Blake
yearned for something more exciting, for
something more sensational. His hopes rose,
when, a month later, he was put on &ldquo;track&rdquo;
work. He was at heart fond of both a good
horse and a good heat. He liked the open air
and the stir and movement and color of the
grand-stand crowds. He liked the &ldquo;ponies&rdquo;
with the sunlight on their satin flanks, the
music of the band, the gaily appareled women.
He liked, too, the off-hand deference of the
men about him, from turnstile to betting shed,
once his calling was known. They were all
ready to curry favor with him, touts and rail-birds,
clockers and owners, jockeys and gamblers
and bookmakers, placating him with an
occasional &ldquo;sure-thing&rdquo; tip from the stables,
plying him with cigars and advice as to how
he should place his money. There was a tacit
understanding, of course, that in return for
these courtesies his vision was not to be too
keen nor his manner too aggressive. When
he was approached by an expert &ldquo;dip&rdquo; with
the offer of a fat reward for immunity in
working the track crowds, Blake carefully
weighed the matter, pro and con, equivocated,
and decided he would gain most by a &ldquo;fall.&rdquo;
So he planted a barber&rsquo;s assistant with whom
he was friendly, descended on the pickpocket
in the very act of going through that bay-rum
scented youth&rsquo;s pocket, and secured a conviction
that brought a letter of thanks from the
club stewards and a word or two of approval
from his head office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>That head office, seeing that they had a man
to be reckoned with, transferred Blake to their
Eastern division, with headquarters at New
York, where new men and new faces were at
the moment badly needed.</p>
<p>They worked him hard, in that new division,
but he never objected. He was sober; he was
dependable; and he was dogged with the doggedness
of the unimaginative. He wanted to
get on, to make good, to be more than a mere
&ldquo;operative.&rdquo; And if his initial assignments
gave him little but &ldquo;rough-neck&rdquo; work to do,
he did it without audible complaint. He did
bodyguard service, he handled strike breakers,
he rounded up freight-car thieves, he was given
occasionally &ldquo;spot&rdquo; and &ldquo;tailing&rdquo; work to do.
Once, after a week of upholstered hotel lounging
on a divorce case he was sent out on night
detail to fight river pirates stealing from the
coal-road barges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>In the meantime, being eager and unsatisfied,
he studied his city. Laboriously and patiently
he made himself acquainted with the
ways of the underworld. He saw that all his
future depended upon acquaintanceship with
criminals, not only with their faces, but with
their ways and their women and their weaknesses.
So he started a gallery, a gallery of
his own, a large and crowded gallery between
walls no wider than the bones of his own skull.
To this jealously guarded and ponderously
sorted gallery he day by day added some new
face, some new scene, some new name. Crook
by crook he stored them away there, for future
reference. He got to know the &ldquo;habituals&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;timers,&rdquo; the &ldquo;gangs&rdquo; and their &ldquo;hang
outs&rdquo; and &ldquo;fences.&rdquo; He acquired an array of
confidence men and hotel beats and queer
shovers and bank sneaks and wire tappers and
drum snuffers. He made a mental record of
dips and yeggs and till-tappers and keister-crackers,
of panhandlers and dummy chuckers,
of sun gazers and schlaum workers. He
slowly became acquainted with their routes
and their rendezvous, their tricks and ways and
records. But, what was more important, he
also grew into an acquaintanceship with ward
politics, with the nameless Power above him
and its enigmatic traditions. He got to know
the Tammany heelers, the men with &ldquo;pull,&rdquo; the
lads who were to be &ldquo;pounded&rdquo; and the lads
who were to be let alone, the men in touch with
the &ldquo;Senator,&rdquo; and the gangs with the fall
money always at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Blake, in those days, was a good &ldquo;mixer.&rdquo;
He was not an &ldquo;office&rdquo; man, and was never
dubbed high-brow. He was not above his
work; no one accused him of being too refined
for his calling. Through a mind such as his
the Law could best view the criminal, just as
a solar eclipse is best viewed through smoked
glass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>He could hobnob with bartenders and red-lighters,
pass unnoticed through a slum, join
casually in a stuss game, or loaf unmarked
about a street corner. He was fond of pool
and billiards, and many were the unconsidered
trifles he picked up with a cue in his hand.
His face, even in those early days, was heavy
and inoffensive. Commonplace seemed to be
the word that fitted him. He could always
mix with and become one of the crowd. He
would have laughed at any such foolish phrase
as &ldquo;protective coloration.&rdquo; Yet seldom, he
knew, men turned back to look at him a second
time. Small-eyed, beefy and well-fed, he
could have passed, under his slightly tilted
black boulder, as a truck driver with a day off.</p>
<p>What others might have denominated as
&ldquo;dirty work&rdquo; he accepted with heavy impassivity,
consoling himself with the contention
that its final end was cleanness. And one of
his most valuable assets, outside his stolid
heartlessness, was his speaking acquaintanceship
with the women of the underworld. He
remained aloof from them even while he mixed
with them. He never grew into a &ldquo;moll-buzzer.&rdquo;
But in his rough way he cultivated
them. He even helped some of them out of
their troubles&mdash;in consideration for &ldquo;tips&rdquo;
which were to be delivered when the emergency
arose. They accepted his gruffness as simple-mindedness,
as blunt honesty. One or two,
with their morbid imaginations touched by his
seeming generosities, made wistful amatory
advances which he promptly repelled. He
could afford to have none of them with anything
&ldquo;on&rdquo; him. He saw the need of keeping
cool headed and clean handed, with an eye always
to the main issue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>And Blake really regarded himself as clean
handed. Yet deep in his nature was that obliquity,
that adeptness at trickery, that facility
in deceit, which made him the success he was.
He could always meet a crook on his own
ground. He had no extraneous sensibilities to
eliminate. He mastered a secret process of
opening and reading letters without detection.
He became an adept at picking a lock. One
of his earlier successes had depended on the
cool dexterity with which he had exchanged
trunk checks in a Wabash baggage car at
Black Rock, allowing the &ldquo;loft&rdquo; thief under
suspicion to carry off a dummy trunk, while
he came into possession of another&rsquo;s belongings
and enough evidence to secure his victim&rsquo;s
conviction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>At another time, when &ldquo;tailing&rdquo; on a
badger-game case, he equipped himself as a
theatrical &ldquo;bill-sniper,&rdquo; followed his man about
without arousing suspicion, and made liberal
use of his magnetized tack-hammer in the final
mix up when he made his haul. He did not
shirk these mix ups, for he was endowed with
the bravery of the unimaginative. This very
mental heaviness, holding him down to materialities,
kept his contemplation of contingencies
from becoming bewildering. He enjoyed
the limitations of the men against whom
he was pitted. Yet at times he had what he
called a &ldquo;coppered hunch.&rdquo; When, in later
years, an occasional criminal of imagination
became his enemy, he was often at a loss as
to how to proceed. But imaginative criminals,
he knew, were rare, and dilemmas such as these
proved infrequent. Whatever his shift, or
however unsavory his resource, he never regarded
himself as on the same basis as his opponents.
He had Law on his side; he was the
instrument of that great power known as
Justice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>As Blake&rsquo;s knowledge of New York and
his work increased he was given less and less
of the &ldquo;rough-neck&rdquo; work to do. He proved
himself, in fact, a stolid and painstaking &ldquo;investigator.&rdquo;
As a divorce-suit shadower he
was equally resourceful and equally successful.
When his agency took over the bankers&rsquo;
protective work he was advanced to this new
department, where he found himself compelled
to a new term of study and a new circle of alliances.
He went laboriously through records
of forgers and check raisers and counterfeiters.
He took up the study of all such gentry, sullenly
yet methodically, like a backward scholar
mastering a newly imposed branch of knowledge,
thumbing frowningly through official
reports, breathing heavily over portrait files
and police records, plodding determinedly
through counterfeit-detector manuals. For
this book work, as he called it, he retained a
deep-seated disgust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>The outcome of his first case, later known
as the &ldquo;Todaro National Ten Case,&rdquo; confirmed
him in this attitude. Going doggedly over the
counterfeit ten-dollar national bank note that
had been given him after two older operatives
had failed in the case, he discovered the word
&ldquo;Dollars&rdquo; in small lettering spelt &ldquo;Ddllers.&rdquo;
Concluding that only a foreigner would make
a mistake of that nature, and knowing the
activity of certain bands of Italians in such
counterfeiting efforts, he began his slow and
scrupulous search through the purlieus of the
East Side. About that search was neither
movement nor romance. It was humdrum,
dogged, disheartening labor, with the gradual
elimination of possibilities and the gradual
narrowing down of his field. But across that
ever-narrowing trail the accidental little clue
finally fell, and on the night of the final raid
the desired plates were captured and the notorious
and long-sought Todaro rounded up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>So successful was Blake during the following
two years that the Washington authorities,
coming in touch with him through the operations
of the Secret Service, were moved to
make him an offer. This offer he stolidly considered
and at last stolidly accepted. He became
an official with the weight of the Federal
authority behind him. He became an investigator
with the secrets of the Bureau of Printing
and Engraving at his beck. He found
himself a cog in a machinery that seemed limitless
in its ramifications. He was the agent
of a vast and centralized authority, an authority
against which there could be no opposition.
But he had to school himself to the knowledge
that he was a cog, and nothing more. And
two things were expected of him, efficiency
and silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>He found a secret pleasure, at first, in the
thought of working from under cover, in the
sense of operating always in the dark, unknown
and unseen. It gave a touch of something
Olympian and godlike to his movements.
But as time went by the small cloud of discontent
on his horizon grew darker, and
widened as it blackened. He was avid of
something more than power. He thirsted not
only for its operation, but also for its display.
He rebelled against the idea of a continually
submerged personality. He nursed a keen
hunger to leave some record of what he did or
had done. He objected to it all as a conspiracy
of obliteration, objected to it as an
actor would object to playing to an empty
theater. There was no one to appreciate and
applaud. And an audience was necessary.
He enjoyed the unctuous salute of the patrolman
on his beat, the deferential door-holding
of &ldquo;office boys,&rdquo; the quick attentiveness of
minor operatives. But this was not enough.
He felt the normal demand to assert himself,
to be known at his true worth by both his fellow
workers and the world in general.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>It was not until the occasion when he had
run down a gang of Williamsburg counterfeiters,
however, that his name was conspicuously
in print. So interesting were the details
of this gang&rsquo;s operations, so typical were
their methods, that Wilkie or some official under
Wilkie had handed over to a monthly
known as <i>The Counterfeit Detector</i> a full account
of the case. A New York paper has
printed a somewhat distorted and romanticized
copy of this, having sent a woman reporter to
interview Blake&mdash;while a staff artist made a
pencil drawing of the Secret Service man during
the very moments the latter was smilingly
denying them either a statement or a photograph.
Blake knew that publicity would impair
his effectiveness. Some inner small voice
forewarned him that all outside recognition of
his calling would take away from his value as
an agent of the Secret Service. But his
hunger for his rights as a man was stronger
than his discretion as an official. He said
nothing openly; but he allowed inferences to
be drawn and the artist&rsquo;s pencil to put the finishing
touches to the sketch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>It was here, too, that his slyness, his natural
circuitiveness, operated to save him. When
the inevitable protest came he was able to prove
that he had said nothing and had indignantly
refused a photograph. He completely cleared
himself. But the hint of an interesting personality
had been betrayed to the public, the
name of a new sleuth had gone on record, and
the infection of curiosity spread like a mulberry
rash from newspaper office to newspaper
office. A representative of the press, every
now and then, would drop in on Blake, or
chance to occupy the same smoking compartment
with him on a run between Washington
and New York, to ply his suavest and subtlest
arts for the extraction of some final fact with
which to cap an unfinished &ldquo;story.&rdquo; Blake,
in turn, became equally subtle and suave. His
lips were sealed, but even silence, he found,
could be made illuminative. Even reticence,
on occasion, could be made to serve his personal
ends. He acquired the trick of surrendering
data without any shadow of actual statement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>These chickens, however, all came home to
roost. Official recognition was taken of
Blake&rsquo;s tendencies, and he was assigned to
those cases where a &ldquo;leak&rdquo; would prove least
embarrassing to the Department. He saw
this and resented it. But in the meantime he
had been keeping his eyes open and storing
up in his cabinet of silence every unsavory
rumor and fact that might prove of use in the
future. He found himself, in due time, the
master of an arsenal of political secrets. And
when it came to a display of power he could
merit the attention if not the respect of a
startlingly wide circle of city officials. When
a New York municipal election brought a
party turn over, he chose the moment as the
psychological one for a display of his power,
cruising up and down the coasts of officialdom
with his grim facts in tow, for all the world
like a flagship followed by its fleet.</p>
<p>It was deemed expedient for the New York
authorities to &ldquo;take care&rdquo; of him. A berth
was made for him in the Central Office, and
after a year of laborious manipulation he
found himself Third Deputy Commissioner
and a power in the land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>If he became a figure of note, and fattened
on power, he found it no longer possible to
keep as free as he wished from entangling alliances.
He had by this time learned to give
and take, to choose the lesser of two evils, to
pay the ordained price for his triumphs. Occasionally
the forces of evil had to be bribed
with a promise of protection. For the surrender
of dangerous plates, for example, a
counterfeiter might receive immunity, or for
the turning of State&rsquo;s evidence a guilty man
might have to go scott free. At other times,
to squeeze confession out of a crook, a cruelty
as refined as that of the Inquisition had to be
adopted. In one stubborn case the end had
been achieved by depriving the victim of sleep,
this Chinese torture being kept up until the
needed nervous collapse. At another time the
midnight cell of a suspected murderer had
been &ldquo;set&rdquo; like a stage, with all the accessories
of his crime, including even the cadaver, and
when suddenly awakened the frenzied man
had shrieked out his confession. But, as a
rule, it was by imposing on his prisoner&rsquo;s better
instincts, such as gang-loyalty or pity for
a supposedly threatened &ldquo;rag,&rdquo; that the point
was won. In resources of this nature Blake
became quite conscienceless, salving his soul
with the altogether jesuitic claim that illegal
means were always justified by the legal end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>By the time he had fought his way up to the
office of Second Deputy he no longer resented
being known as a &ldquo;rough neck&rdquo; or a &ldquo;flat
foot.&rdquo; As an official, he believed in roughness;
it was his right; and one touch of right
made away with all wrong, very much as
one grain of pepsin properly disposed might
digest a carload of beef. A crook was a crook.
His natural end was the cell or the chair, and
the sooner he got there the better for all concerned.
So Blake believed in &ldquo;hammering&rdquo;
his victims. He was an advocate of &ldquo;confrontation.&rdquo;
He had faith in the old-fashioned
&ldquo;third-degree&rdquo; dodges. At these, in his
ponderous way, he became an adept, looking
on the nervous system of his subject as a nut,
to be calmly and relentlessly gnawed at until
the meat of truth lay exposed, or to be cracked
by the impact of some sudden great shock.
Nor was the Second Deputy above resorting to
the use of &ldquo;plants.&rdquo; Sometimes he had to call
in a &ldquo;fixer&rdquo; to manufacture evidence, that the
far-off ends of justice might not be defeated.
He made frequent use of women of a certain
type, women whom he could intimidate as an
officer or buy over as a good fellow. He had
his <i>aides</i> in all walks of life, in clubs and offices,
in pawnshops and saloons, in hotels and
steamers and barber shops, in pool rooms and
anarchists&rsquo; cellars. He also had his visiting
list, his &ldquo;fences&rdquo; and &ldquo;stool-pigeons&rdquo; and
&ldquo;shoo-flies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>He preferred the &ldquo;outdoor&rdquo; work, both
because he was more at home in it and because
it was more spectacular. He relished the bigger
cases. He liked to step in where an underling
had failed, get his teeth into the situation,
shake the mystery out of it, and then
obliterate the underling with a half hour of
blasphemous abuse. He had scant patience
with what he called the &ldquo;high-collar cops.&rdquo; He
consistently opposed the new-fangled methods,
such as the <i>Portrait Parle</i>, and pin-maps for
recording crime, and the graphic-system boards
for marking the movements of criminals.
All anthropometric nonsense such as Bertillon&rsquo;s
he openly sneered at, just as he scoffed
at card indexes and finger prints and other
academic innovations which were debilitating
the force. He had gathered his own data, at
great pains, he nursed his own personal knowledge
as to habitual offenders and their aliases,
their methods, their convictions and records,
their associates and hang outs. He carried
his own gallery under his own hat, and he was
proud of it. His memory was good, and he
claimed always to know his man. His intuitions
were strong, and if he disliked a captive,
that captive was in some way guilty&mdash;and he
saw to it that his man did not escape. He was
relentless, once his professional pride was involved.
Being without imagination, he was
without pity. It was, at best, a case of dog
eat dog, and the Law, the Law for which he
had such reverence, happened to keep him the
upper dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Yet he was a comparatively stupid man, an
amazingly self-satisfied toiler who had chanced
to specialize on crime. And even as he became
more and more assured of his personal
ability, more and more entrenched in his tradition
of greatness, he was becoming less and
less elastic, less receptive, less adaptive.
Much as he tried to blink the fact, he was compelled
to depend more and more on the office
behind him. His personal gallery, the gallery
under his hat, showed a tendency to become
both obsolete and inadequate. That endless
catacomb of lost souls grew too intricate for
one human mind to compass. New faces, new
names, new tricks tended to bewilder him. He
had to depend more and more on the clerical
staff and the finger-print bureau records. His
position became that of a villager with a department
store on his hands, of a country shopkeeper
trying to operate an urban emporium.
He was averse to deputizing his official labors.
He was ignorant of system and science. He
took on the pathos of a man who is out of his
time, touched with the added poignancy of a
passionate incredulity as to his predicament.
He felt, at times, that there was something
wrong, that the rest of the Department did
not look on life and work as he did. But he
could not decide just where the trouble lay.
And in his uncertainty he made it a point to
entrench himself by means of &ldquo;politics.&rdquo; It
became an open secret that he had a pull, that
his position was impregnable. This in turn
tended to coarsen his methods. It lifted him
beyond the domain of competitive effort. It
touched his carelessness with arrogance. It
also tinged his arrogance with occasional cruelty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>He redoubled his efforts to sustain the myth
which had grown up about him, the myth of
his vast cleverness and personal courage. He
showed a tendency for the more turbulent centers.
He went among murderers without a
gun. He dropped into dives, protected by
nothing more than the tradition of his office.
He pushed his way in through thugs, picked
out his man, and told him to come to Headquarters
in an hour&rsquo;s time&mdash;and the man usually
came. His appetite for the spectacular
increased. He preferred to head his own
gambling raids, ax in hand. But more even
than his authority he liked to parade his knowledge.
He liked to be able to say: &ldquo;This is
Sheeny Chi&rsquo;s coup!&rdquo; or, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a job that
only Soup-Can Charlie could do!&rdquo; When a
police surgeon hit on the idea of etherizing an
obdurate &ldquo;dummy chucker,&rdquo; to determine if
the prisoner could talk or not, Blake appropriated
the suggestion as his own. And when
the &ldquo;press boys&rdquo; trooped in for their daily gist
of news, he asked them, as usual, not to couple
his name with the incident; and they, as usual,
made him the hero of the occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>For Never-Fail Blake had made it a point
to be good to the press boys. He acquired an
ability to &ldquo;jolly&rdquo; them without too obvious loss
of dignity. He took them into his confidences,
apparently, and made his disclosures personal
matters, individual favors. He kept careful
note of their names, their characteristics, their
interests. He cultivated them, keeping as
careful track of them from city to city as he
did of the &ldquo;big&rdquo; criminals themselves. They
got into the habit of going to him for their
special stories. He always exacted secrecy,
pretended reluctance, yet parceled out to one
reporter and another those dicta to which his
name could be most appropriately attached.
He even surrendered a clue or two as to how
his own activities and triumphs might be
worked into a given story. When he perceived
that those worldly wise young men of
the press saw through the dodge, he became
more adept, more adroit, more delicate in
method. But the end was the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>It was about this time that he invested in his
first scrap-book. Into this secret granary went
every seed of his printed personal history.
Then came the higher records of the magazines,
the illustrated articles written about &ldquo;Blake,
the Hamard of America,&rdquo; as one of them expressed
it, and &ldquo;Never-Fail Blake,&rdquo; as another
put it. He was very proud of those
magazine articles, he even made ponderous and
painstaking efforts for their repetition, at considerable
loss of dignity. Yet he adopted the
pose of disclaiming responsibility, of disliking
such things, of being ready to oppose them
if some effective method could only be thought
out. He even hinted to those about him at
Headquarters that this seeming garrulity was
serving a good end, claiming it to be harmless
pother to &ldquo;cover&rdquo; more immediate trails on
which he pretended to be engaged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>But the scrap-books grew in number and
size. It became a task to keep up with his
clippings. He developed into a personage, as
much a personage as a grand-opera prima
donna on tour. His successes were talked over
in clubs. His name came to be known to the
men in the street. His &ldquo;camera eye&rdquo; was now
and then mentioned by the scientists. His unblemished
record was referred to in an occasional
editorial. When an ex-police reporter
came to him, asking him to father a macaronic
volume bearing the title &ldquo;Criminals of America,&rdquo;
Blake not only added his name to the title
page, but advanced three hundred dollars to
assist towards its launching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>The result of all this was a subtle yet unmistakable
shifting of values, an achievement of
public glory at the loss of official confidence.
He excused his waning popularity among his
co-workers on the ground of envy. It was, he
held, merely the inevitable penalty for supreme
success in any field. But a hint would
come, now and then, that troubled him. &ldquo;You
think you&rsquo;re a big gun, Blake,&rdquo; one of his underworld
victims once had the temerity to cry
out at him. &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re the king of
the Hawkshaws! But if you were on <i>my</i> side
of the fence, you&rsquo;d last about as long as a snowball
on a crownsheet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c3">III</h2>
<p>It was not until the advent of Copeland, the
new First Deputy, that Blake began to suspect
his own position. Copeland was an out-and-out
&ldquo;office&rdquo; man, anything but a &ldquo;flat
foot.&rdquo; Weak looking and pallid, with the sedentary
air of a junior desk clerk, vibratingly
restless with no actual promise of being penetrating,
he was of that indeterminate type
which never seems to acquire a personality of
its own. The small and bony and steel-blue
face was as neutral as the spare and reticent
figure that sat before a bald table in a bald
room as inexpressive and reticent as its occupant.
Copeland was not only unknown outside
the Department; he was, in a way, unknown
in his own official circles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>And then Blake woke up to the fact that
some one on the inside was working against
him, was blocking his moves, was actually using
him as a &ldquo;blind.&rdquo; While he was given the
&ldquo;cold&rdquo; trails, younger men went out on the
&ldquo;hot&rdquo; ones. There were times when the Second
Deputy suspected that his enemy was
Copeland. Not that he could be sure of this,
for Copeland himself gave no inkling of his attitude.
He gave no inkling of anything, in fact,
personal or impersonal. But more and more
Blake was given the talking parts, the r&ocirc;le of
spokesman to the press. He was more and
more posted in the background, like artillery,
to intimidate with his remote thunder and
cover the advance of more agile columns. He
was encouraged to tell the public what he
knew, but he was not allowed to know too
much. And, ironically enough, he bitterly resented
this r&ocirc;le of &ldquo;mouthpiece&rdquo; for the Department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You call yourself a gun!&rdquo; a patrolman who
had been shaken down for insubordination
broke out at him. &ldquo;A gun! why, you&rsquo;re only
a <i>park</i> gun! That&rsquo;s all you are, a broken-down
bluff, an ornamental has-been, a park
gun for kids to play &rsquo;round!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Blake raged at that, impotently, pathetically,
like an old lion with its teeth drawn. He
prowled moodily around, looking for an enemy
on whom to vent his anger. But he could find
no tangible force that opposed him. He could
see nothing on which to centralize his activity.
Yet something or somebody was working
against him. To fight that opposition was like
fighting a fog. It was as bad as trying to
shoulder back a shadow.</p>
<p>He had his own &ldquo;spots&rdquo; and &ldquo;finders&rdquo; on the
force. When he had been tipped off that the
powers above were about to send him out on
the Binhart case, he passed the word along to
his underlings, without loss of time, for he felt
that he was about to be put on trial, that they
were making the Binhart capture a test case.
And he had rejoiced mightily when his dragnet
had brought up the unexpected tip that
Elsie Verriner had been in recent communication
with Binhart, and with pressure from the
right quarter could be made to talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>This tip had been a secret one. Blake, on
his part, kept it well muffled, for he intended
that his capture of Binhart should be not only
a personal triumph for the Second Deputy,
but a vindication of that Second Deputy&rsquo;s
methods.</p>
<p>So when the Commissioner called him and
Copeland into conference, the day after his
talk with Elsie Verriner, Blake prided himself
on being secretly prepared for any advances
that might be made.</p>
<p>It was the Commissioner who did the talking.
Copeland, as usual, lapsed into the background,
cracking his dry knuckles and blinking
his pale-blue eyes about the room as the voices
of the two larger men boomed back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been going over this Binhart case,&rdquo;
began the Commissioner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s seven months
now&mdash;and nothing done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake looked sideways at Copeland. There
was muffled and meditative belligerency in the
look. There was also gratification, for it was
the move he had been expecting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always said McCooey wasn&rsquo;t the man to
go out on that case,&rdquo; said the Second Deputy,
still watching Copeland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then who <i>is</i> the man?&rdquo; asked the Commissioner.</p>
<p>Blake took out a cigar, bit the end off, and
struck a match. It was out of place; but it
was a sign of his independence. He had long
since given up plug and fine-cut and taken to
fat Havanas, which he smoked audibly, in
plethoric wheezes. Good living had left his
body stout and his breathing slightly asthmatic.
He sat looking down at his massive knees; his
oblique study of Copeland, apparently, had
yielded him scant satisfaction. Copeland, in
fact, was making paper fans out of the official
note-paper in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Washington and
Wilkie?&rdquo; inquired Blake, attentively regarding
his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just where we are&mdash;at a standstill,&rdquo;
acknowledged the Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll stay!&rdquo; heavily contended
the Second Deputy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The entire situation was an insidiously flattering
one to Blake. Every one else had
failed. They were compelled to come to him,
their final resource.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded his superior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we haven&rsquo;t got a man who can
turn the trick! We haven&rsquo;t got a man who
can go out and round up Binhart inside o&rsquo;
seven years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is your suggestion?&rdquo; It was
Copeland who spoke, mild and hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo; you want my suggestion?&rdquo; demanded
Blake, warm with the wine-like knowledge
which, he knew, made him master of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; was the Commissioner&rsquo;s curt
response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got to have a man who knows
Binhart, who knows him and his tricks and his
hang outs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; declared Blake.</p>
<p>The Commissioner indulged in his wintry
smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean if you weren&rsquo;t tied down to your
Second Deputy&rsquo;s chair you could go out and
get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within a reasonable length of time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the time! But I could
get him, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were still on the outside work?&rdquo; interposed
Copeland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t expect to dig him out
o&rsquo; my stamp drawer,&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s heavily
facetious retort.</p>
<p>Copeland and the Commissioner looked at
each other, for one fraction of a second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what my feeling is,&rdquo; resumed
the latter, &ldquo;on this Binhart case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what <i>my</i> feeling is,&rdquo; declared
Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the right method would&rsquo;ve got him
six months ago, without all this monkey
work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not end the monkey work, as you
call it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By doing what you say you can do!&rdquo; was
the Commissioner&rsquo;s retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;m I going to hold down a chair and
hunt a crook at the same time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why hold down the chair? Let the
chair take care of itself. It could be arranged,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake had the stage-juggler&rsquo;s satisfaction of
seeing things fall into his hands exactly as he
had man&oelig;uvered they should. His reluctance
was merely a dissimulation, a stage wait for
heightened dramatic effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do the arranging?&rdquo; he calmly
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could see the Mayor in the morning.
There will be no Departmental difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is none, if you are willing to go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t get Binhart here by pink-tea
invitations. Somebody&rsquo;s got to go out and
<i>get</i> him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The bank raised the reward to eight thousand
this week,&rdquo; interposed the ruminative
Copeland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;ll take money to get him,&rdquo; snapped
back the Second Deputy, remembering that he
had a nest of his own to feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be worth what it costs,&rdquo; admitted the
Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Copeland, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll have to
honor your drafts&mdash;in reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no difficulty on the expense
side,&rdquo; quietly interposed the Commissioner.
&ldquo;The city wants Binhart. The whole country
wants Binhart. And they will be willing to
pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake rose heavily to his feet. His massive
bulk was momentarily stirred by the prospect
of the task before him. For one brief moment
the anticipation of that clamor of approval
which would soon be his stirred his
lethargic pulse. Then his cynic calmness again
came back to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;re we beefing about?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;You want Binhart and I&rsquo;ll get
him for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>The Commissioner, tapping the top of his
desk with his gold-banded fountain pen,
smiled. It was almost a smile of indulgence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>know</i> you will get him?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>The inquiry seemed to anger Blake. He
was still dimly conscious of the operation of
forces which he could not fathom. There were
things, vague and insubstantial, which he could
not understand. But he nursed to his heavy-breathing
bosom the consciousness that he himself
was not without his own undivulged
powers, his own private tricks, his own inner reserves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo; he calmly proclaimed.
&ldquo;And I guess that ought to be enough!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h2 id="c4">IV</h2>
<p>The unpretentious, brownstone-fronted
home of Deputy Copeland was visited,
late that night, by a woman. She was dressed
in black, and heavily veiled. She walked with
the stoop of a sorrowful and middle-aged
widow.</p>
<p>She came in a taxicab, which she dismissed
at the corner. From the house steps she looked
first eastward and then westward, as though to
make sure she was not being followed. Then
she rang the bell.</p>
<p>She gave no name; yet she was at once admitted.
Her visit, in fact, seemed to be expected,
for without hesitation she was ushered
upstairs and into the library of the First Deputy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>He was waiting for her in a room more intimate,
more personal, more companionably
crowded than his office, for the simple reason
that it was not a room of his own fashioning.
He stood in the midst of its warm hangings,
in fact, as cold and neutral as the marble Diana
behind him. He did not even show, as he
closed the door and motioned his visitor into a
chair, that he had been waiting for her.</p>
<p>The woman, still standing, looked carefully
about the room, from side to side, saw that they
were alone, made note of the two closed doors,
and then with a sigh lifted her black gloved
hands and began to remove the widow&rsquo;s cap
from her head. She sighed again as she tossed
the black crepe on the dark-wooded table beside
her. As she sank into the chair the light
from the electrolier fell on her shoulders and on
the carefully coiled and banded hair, so laboriously
built up into a crown that glinted nut-brown
above the pale face she turned to the
man watching her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said. And from under her
level brows she stared at Copeland, serene in
her consciousness of power. It was plain that
she neither liked him nor disliked him. It was
equally plain that he, too, had his ends remote
from her and her being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw Blake again?&rdquo; he half asked, half
challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you we&rsquo;d take care of your
end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had promises like that before. They
weren&rsquo;t always remembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our office never made you that promise
before, Miss Verriner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman let her eyes rest on his impassive
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, I admit. But I must also admit
I know Jim Blake. We&rsquo;d better not
come together again, Blake and me, after this
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was pulling off her gloves as she spoke.
She suddenly threw them down on the table.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one thing I want to know, and
know for certain. I want to know if this is a
plant to shoot Blake up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>The First Deputy smiled. It was not altogether
at the mere calmness with which she
could suggest such an atrocity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>He was both patient and painstaking with
her. His tone was almost paternal in its placativeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely a phase of departmental business,&rdquo;
he answered her. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re anxious
to see Blake round up Connie Binhart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; she answered with neither
heat nor resentment, &ldquo;or you would never have
started him off on this blind lead. You&rsquo;d
never have had me go to him with that King
Edward note and had it work out to fit a street
in Montreal. You&rsquo;ve got a wooden decoy up
there in Canada, and when Blake gets there
he&rsquo;ll be told his man slipped away the day before.
Then another decoy will bob up, and
Blake will go after that. And when you&rsquo;ve
fooled him two or three times he&rsquo;ll sail back
to New York and break me for giving him a
false tip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you give it to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he hammered it out of me. But you
knew he was going to do that. That was part
of the plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat studying her thin white hands for
several seconds. Then she looked up at the
calm-eyed Copeland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to protect me, if Blake
comes back? How are you going to keep your
promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The First Deputy sat back in his chair and
crossed his thin legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blake will not come back,&rdquo; he announced.
She slewed suddenly round on him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it <i>is</i> a plant!&rdquo; she proclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You misunderstand me, Miss Verriner.
Blake will not come back as an official. There
will be changes in the Department, I imagine;
changes for the better which even he and his
Tammany Hall friends can&rsquo;t stop, by the time
he gets back with Binhart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman gave a little hand gesture of impatience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;supposing
he gives up Binhart? Supposing he suspects
something and hurries back to hold down
his place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call him Never-Fail Blake,&rdquo; commented
the unmoved and dry-lipped official.
He met her wide stare with his gently satiric
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she finally said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going
to shoot him up. You&rsquo;re merely going to
wipe him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite wrong there,&rdquo; began the man
across the table from her. &ldquo;Administration
changes may happen, and in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, you&rsquo;re getting Jim Blake
out of the way, off on this Binhart trail, while
you work him out of the Department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No competent officer is ever worked out of
this Department,&rdquo; parried the First Deputy.</p>
<p>She sat for a silent and studious moment or
two, without looking at Copeland. Then she
sighed, with mock plaintiveness. Her wistfulness
seemed to leave her doubly dangerous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Copeland, aren&rsquo;t you afraid some one
might find it worth while to tip Blake off?&rdquo; she
softly inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you gain?&rdquo; was his pointed and
elliptical interrogation.</p>
<p>She leaned forward in the fulcrum of light,
and looked at him soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your idea of me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He looked back at the thick-lashed eyes with
their iris rings of deep gray. There was something
alert and yet unparticipating in their
steady gaze. They held no trace of abashment.
They were no longer veiled. There
was even something disconcerting in their lucid
and level stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are a very intelligent woman,&rdquo;
Copeland finally confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I am, too,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Although
I haven&rsquo;t used that intelligence in the
right way. Don&rsquo;t smile! I&rsquo;m not going to
turn mawkish. I&rsquo;m not good. I don&rsquo;t know
whether I want to be. But I know one thing:
I&rsquo;ve got to keep busy&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to be active.
I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to be!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; prompted the First Deputy, as she
came to a stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all know, now, exactly where we&rsquo;re at.
We all know what we want, each one of us.
We know what Blake wants. We know what
you want. And I want something more than
I&rsquo;m getting, just as you want something more
than writing reports and rounding up push-cart
peddlers. I want my end, as much as you
want yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; again prompted the First Deputy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to the end of my ropes; and I
want to swing around. It&rsquo;s no reform bee,
mind! It&rsquo;s not what other women like me
think it is. But I can&rsquo;t go on. It doesn&rsquo;t
lead to anything. It doesn&rsquo;t pay. I want to
be safe. I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to be safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up suddenly, as though a new
truth had just struck home with him. For the
first time, all that evening, his face was ingenuous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s behind me,&rdquo; went on the
woman. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use digging that up.
And there&rsquo;s no use digging up excuses for it.
But there <i>are</i> excuses&mdash;good excuses, or I&rsquo;d
never have gone through what I have, because
I feel I wasn&rsquo;t made for it. I&rsquo;m too big a
coward to face what it leads to. I can look
ahead and see through things. I can understand
too easily.&rdquo; She came to a stop, and sat
back, with one white hand on either arm of
the chair. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid to go on. I want
to begin over. And I want to begin on the
right side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat pondering just how much of this he
could believe. But she disregarded his veiled
impassivity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to take Picture 3,970 out of the
Identification Bureau, the picture and the Bertillon
measurements. And then I want you
to give me the chance I asked for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that does not rest with me, Miss Verriner!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will rest with you. I couldn&rsquo;t stool with
my own people here. But Wilkie knows my
value. He knows what I can do for the service
if I&rsquo;m on their side. He could let me
begin with the Ellis Island spotting. I could
stop that Stockholm white-slave work in two
months. And when you see Wilkie to-morrow
you can swing me one way or the other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Copeland, with his chin on his bony breast,
looked up to smile into her intent and staring
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very clever woman,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And what is more, you know a great deal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a great deal!&rdquo; she slowly repeated,
and her steady gaze succeeded in taking the
ironic smile out of the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your knowledge,&rdquo; he said with a deliberation
equal to her own, &ldquo;will prove of great
value to you&mdash;as an agent with Wilkie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as you say!&rdquo; she quietly amended
as she rose to her feet. There was no actual
threat in her words, just as there was no actual
mockery in his. But each was keenly conscious
of the wheels that revolved within wheels,
of the intricacies through which each was
threading a way to certain remote ends. She
picked up her black gloves from the desk top.
She stood there, waiting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can count on me,&rdquo; he finally said, as
he rose from his chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to the
picture. And I&rsquo;ll say the right thing to Wilkie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s shake hands on it!&rdquo; she quietly
concluded. And as they shook hands her gray-irised
eyes gazed intently and interrogatively
into his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c5">V</h2>
<p>When Never-Fail Blake alighted from
his sleeper in Montreal he found one
of Teal&rsquo;s men awaiting him at Bonaventure
Station. There had been a hitch or a leak
somewhere, this man reported. Binhart, in
some way, had slipped through their fingers.</p>
<p>All they knew was that the man they were
tailing had bought a ticket for Winnipeg, that
he was not in Montreal, and that, beyond the
railway ticket, they had no trace of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Blake, at this news, had a moment when he
saw red. He felt, during that moment, like
a drum-major who had &ldquo;muffed&rdquo; his baton on
parade. Then recovering himself, he promptly
confirmed the Teal operative&rsquo;s report by telephone,
accepted its confirmation as authentic,
consulted a timetable, and made a dash for
Windsor Station. There he caught the Winnipeg
express, took possession of a stateroom
and indited carefully worded telegrams to
Trimble in Vancouver, that all out-going Pacific
steamers should be watched, and to Menzler
in Chicago, that the American city might
be covered in case of Binhart&rsquo;s doubling southward
on him. Still another telegram he sent
to New York, requesting the Police Department
to send on to him at once a photograph of
Binhart.</p>
<p>In Winnipeg, two days later, Blake found
himself on a blind trail. When he had talked
with a railway detective on whom he could rely,
when he had visited certain offices and interviewed
certain officials, when he had sought out
two or three women acquaintances in the city&rsquo;s
sequestered area, he faced the bewildering
discovery that he was still without an actual
clue of the man he was supposed to be shadowing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>It was then that something deep within his
nature, something he could never quite define,
whispered its first faint doubt to him. This
doubt persisted even when late that night a
Teal Agency operative wired him from Calgary,
stating that a man answering Binhart&rsquo;s
description had just left the Alberta Hotel for
Banff. To this latter point Blake promptly
wired a fuller description of his man, had an
officer posted to inspect every alighting passenger,
and early the next morning received
a telegram, asking for still more particulars.</p>
<p>He peered down at this message, vaguely
depressed in spirit, discarding theory after theory,
tossing aside contingency after contingency.
And up from this gloomy shower
slowly emerged one of his &ldquo;hunches,&rdquo; one of
his vague impressions, coming blindly to the
surface very much like an earthworm crawling
forth after a fall of rain. There was
something wrong. Of that he felt certain.
He could not place it or define it. To continue
westward would be to depend too much
on an uncertainty; it would involve the risk of
wandering too far from the center of things.
He suddenly decided to double on his tracks
and swing down to Chicago. Just why he
felt as he did he could not fathom. But the
feeling was there. It was an instinctive propulsion,
a &ldquo;hunch.&rdquo; These hunches were to
him, working in the dark as he was compelled
to, very much what whiskers are to a cat. They
could not be called an infallible guide. But
they at least kept him from colliding with impregnabilities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Acting on this hunch, as he called it, he
caught a Great Northern train for Minneapolis,
transferred to a Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St.
Paul express, and without loss of time sped
southward. When, thirty hours later, he
alighted in the heart of Chicago, he found himself
in an environment more to his liking, more
adaptable to his ends. He was not disheartened
by his failure. He did not believe in
luck, in miracles, or even in coincidence. But
experience had taught him the bewildering
extent of the resources which he might command.
So intricate and so wide-reaching were
the secret wires of his information that he knew
he could wait, like a spider at the center of its
web, until the betraying vibration awakened
some far-reaching thread of that web. In
every corner of the country lurked a non-professional
ally, a secluded tipster, ready to report
to Blake when the call for a report came.
The world, that great detective had found,
was indeed a small one. From its scattered
four corners, into which his subterranean wires
of espionage stretched, would in time come
some inkling, some hint, some discovery. And
at the converging center of those wires Blake
was able to sit and wait, like the central operator
at a telephone switchboard, knowing that
the tentacles of attention were creeping and
wavering about dim territories and that in time
they would render up their awaited word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>In the meantime, Blake himself was by no
means idle. It would not be from official circles,
he knew, that his redemption would come.
Time had already proved that. For months
past every police chief in the country had held
his description of Binhart. That was a fact
which Binhart himself very well knew; and
knowing that, he would continue to move as
he had been moving, with the utmost secrecy,
or at least protected by some adequate disguise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>It would be from the underworld that the
echo would come. And next to New York,
Blake knew, Chicago would make as good a
central exchange for this underworld as could
be desired. Knowing that city of the Middle
West, and knowing it well, he at once &ldquo;went
down the line,&rdquo; making his rounds stolidly and
systematically, first visiting a West Side faro-room
and casually interviewing the &ldquo;stools&rdquo; of
Custom House Place and South Clark Street,
and then dropping in at the Caf&eacute; Acropolis, in
Halsted Street, and lodging houses in even less
savory quarters. He duly canvassed every
likely dive, every &ldquo;melina,&rdquo; every gambling
house and yegg hang out. He engaged in leisurely
games of pool with stone-getters and
gopher men. He visited bucket-shops and barrooms,
and dingy little Ghetto caf&eacute;s. He
&ldquo;buzzed&rdquo; tipsters and floaters and mouthpieces.
He fraternized with till tappers and
single-drillers. He always made his inquiries
after Binhart seem accidental, a case apparently
subsidiary to two or three others which he
kept always to the foreground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>He did not despair over the discovery that
no one seemed to know of Binhart or his movements.
He merely waited his time, and extended
new ramifications into newer territory.
His word still carried its weight of official authority.
There was still an army of obsequious
underlings compelled to respect his wishes. It
was merely a matter of time and mathematics.
Then the law of averages would ordain its end;
the needed card would ultimately be turned up,
the right dial-twist would at last complete the
right combination.</p>
<p>The first faint glimmer of life, in all those
seemingly dead wires, came from a gambler
named Mattie Sherwin, who reported that he
had met Binhart, two weeks before, in the caf&eacute;
of the Brown Palace in Denver. He was traveling
under the name of Bannerman, wore his
hair in a pomadour, and had grown a beard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Blake took the first train out of Chicago for
Denver. In this latter city an Elks&rsquo; Convention
was supplying blue-bird weather for underground
&ldquo;haymakers,&rdquo; busy with bunco-steering,
&ldquo;rushing&rdquo; street-cars and &ldquo;lifting
leathers.&rdquo; Before the stampede at the news
of his approach, he picked up Biff Edwards
and Lefty Stivers, put on the screws, and
learned nothing. He went next to Glory McShane,
a Market Street acquaintance indebted
for certain old favors, and from her, too,
learned nothing of moment. He continued the
quest in other quarters, and the results were
equally discouraging.</p>
<p>Then began the real detective work about
which, Blake knew, newspaper stories were seldom
written. This work involved a laborious
and monotonous examination of hotel registers,
a canvassing of ticket agencies and cab stands
and transfer companies. It was anything but
story-book sleuthing. It was a dispiriting
tread-mill round, but he was still sifting doggedly
through the tailings of possibilities when
a code-wire came from St. Louis, saying Binhart
had been seen the day before at the Planters&rsquo;
Hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Blake was eastbound on his way to St. Louis
one hour after the receipt of this wire. And
an hour after his arrival in St. Louis he was engaged
in an apparently care free and leisurely
game of pool with one Loony Ryan, an old-time
&ldquo;box man&rdquo; who was allowed to roam with
a clipped wing in the form of a suspended indictment.
Loony, for the liberty thus doled
out to him, rewarded his benefactors by an occasional
indulgence in the &ldquo;pigeon-act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Draw for lead?&rdquo; asked Blake, lighting a
cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Loony.</p>
<p>Blake pushed his ball to the top cushion, won
the draw, and broke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen anything of Wolf Yonkholm?&rdquo; he
casually inquired, as he turned to chalk his cue.
But his eye, with one quick sweep, had made
sure of every face in the room.</p>
<p>Loony studied the balls for a second or two.
Wolf was a &ldquo;dip&rdquo; with an international record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last time I saw Wolf he was out at
&rsquo;Frisco, workin&rsquo; the Beaches,&rdquo; was Loony&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Blake ventured an inquiry or two about other
worthies of the underworld. The players went
on with their game, placid, self-immured, matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Angel McGlory these days?&rdquo;
asked Blake, as he reached over to place a ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she been doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded Loony,
with his cue on the rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s traveling with a bank sneak named
Blanchard or Binhart,&rdquo; explained Blake.
&ldquo;And I want her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loony Ryan made his stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hep Roony saw Binhart this mornin&rsquo;, beatin&rsquo;
it for N&rsquo; Orleans. But he wasn&rsquo;t travelin&rsquo;
wit&rsquo; any moll that Hep spoke of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake made his shot, chalked his cue again,
and glanced down at his watch. His eyes were
on the green baize, but his thoughts were elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got &rsquo;o leave you, Wolf,&rdquo; he announced as
he put his cue back in the rack. He spoke
slowly and calmly. But Wolf&rsquo;s quick gaze circled
the room, promptly checking over every
face between the four walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d you
spot?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Wolf, nothing! But this game
o&rsquo; yours blamed near made me forget an appointment
o&rsquo; mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes after he had left the bewildered
Wolf Ryan in the pool parlor he was
in a New Orleans sleeper, southward bound.
He knew that he was getting within striking
distance of Binhart, at last. The zest of the
chase took possession of him. The trail was
no longer a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; one. He knew which way
Binhart was headed. And he knew he was not
more than a day behind his man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<h2 id="c6">VI</h2>
<p>The moment Blake arrived in New Orleans
he shut himself in a telephone booth,
called up six somewhat startled acquaintances,
learned nothing to his advantage, and went
quickly but quietly to the St. Charles. There
he closeted himself with two dependable &ldquo;elbows,&rdquo;
started his detectives on a round of the
hotels, and himself repaired to the Levee district,
where he held off-handed and ponderously
facetious conversations with certain unsavory
characters. Then came a visit to certain
equally unsavory wharf-rats and a call or
two on South Rampart Street. But still no
inkling of Binhart or his intended movements
came to the detective&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>It was not until the next morning, as he
stepped into Antoine&rsquo;s, on St. Louis Street
just off the Rue Royal, that anything of importance
occurred. The moment he entered
that bare and cloistral restaurant where Monsieur
Jules could dish up such startling uncloistral
dishes, his eyes fell on Abe Sheiner,
a drum snuffer with whom he had had previous
and somewhat painful encounters. Sheiner, it
was plain to see, was in clover, for he was breakfasting
regally, on squares of toast covered
with shrimp and picked crab meat creamed,
with a bisque of cray-fish and <i>papa-bottes</i> in
ribbons of bacon, to say nothing of fruit and
<i>bruilleau</i>.</p>
<p>Blake insisted on joining his old friend
Sheiner, much to the latter&rsquo;s secret discomfiture.
It was obvious that the drum snuffer, having
made a recent haul, would be amenable to
persuasion. And, like all yeggs, he was an upholder
of the &ldquo;moccasin telegraph,&rdquo; a wanderer
and a carrier of stray tidings as to the movements
of others along the undergrooves of the
world. So while Blake breakfasted on shrimp
and crab meat and French artichokes stuffed
with caviar and anchovies, he intimated to the
uneasy-minded Sheiner certain knowledge as
to a certain recent coup. In the face of this
charge Sheiner indignantly claimed that he had
only been playing the ponies and having a run
of greenhorn&rsquo;s luck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Abe, I&rsquo;ve come down to gather you in,&rdquo;
announced the calmly mendacious detective.
He continued to sip his bruilleau with fraternal
unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got nothing <i>on</i> me, Jim,&rdquo; protested the
other, losing his taste for the delicacies arrayed
about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we got &rsquo;o go down to Headquarters
and talk that over,&rdquo; calmly persisted Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of pounding me, when I&rsquo;m
on the square again?&rdquo; persisted the ex-drum
snuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the line o&rsquo; talk they all hand out.
That&rsquo;s what Connie Binhart said when we had
it out up in St. Louis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you bump into Binhart in St. Louis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a talk, three days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why&rsquo;d he blow through this town as
though he had a regiment o&rsquo; bulls and singed
cats behind him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Blake&rsquo;s heart went down like an elevator with
a broken cable. But he gave no outward sign
of this inward commotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he wants to get down to Colon before
the Hamburg-American boat hits the
port,&rdquo; ventured Blake. &ldquo;His moll&rsquo;s aboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he blew out for &rsquo;Frisco this morning,&rdquo;
contended the puzzled Sheiner. &ldquo;Shot through
as though he&rsquo;d just had a rumble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he <i>said</i> that, but he went south, all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he went in an oyster sloop. There&rsquo;s
nothing sailing from this port to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s Binhart got to do with our
trouble anyway? What I want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw him start,&rdquo; persisted the other.
&ldquo;He ducked for a day coach and said he was
traveling for his health. And he sure looked
like a man in a hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Blake sipped his bruilleau, glanced casually
at his watch, and took out a cigar and lighted
it. He blinked contentedly across the table at
the man he was &ldquo;buzzing.&rdquo; The trick had been
turned. The word had been given. He knew
that Binhart was headed westward again. He
also knew that Binhart had awakened to the
fact that he was being followed, that his feverish
movements were born of a stampeding fear
of capture.</p>
<p>Yet Binhart was not a coward. Flight, in
fact, was his only resource. It was only the
low-brow criminal, Blake knew, who ran for a
hole and hid in it until he was dragged out.
The more intellectual type of offender preferred
the open. And Binhart was of this
type. He was suave and artful; he was active
bodied and experienced in the ways of the
world. What counted still more, he was well
heeled with money. Just how much he had
planted away after the Newcomb coup no one
knew. But no one denied that it was a fortune.
It was ten to one that Binhart would
now try to get out of the country. He would
make his way to some territory without an extradition
treaty. He would look for a land
where he could live in peace, where his ill-gotten
wealth would make exile endurable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Blake, as he smoked his cigar and turned
these thoughts over in his mind, could afford
to smile. There would be no peace and no rest
for Connie Binhart; he himself would see to
that. And he would &ldquo;get&rdquo; his man; whether it
was in a week&rsquo;s time or a month&rsquo;s time, he would
&ldquo;get&rdquo; his man and take him back in triumph to
New York. He would show Copeland and the
Commissioner and the world in general that
there was still a little life in the old dog,
that there was still a haul or two he could
make.</p>
<p>So engrossing were these thoughts that
Blake scarcely heard the drum snuffer across
the table from him, protesting the innocence
of his ways and the purity of his intentions.
Then for the second time that morning Blake
completely bewildered him, by suddenly accepting
those protestations and agreeing to let
everything drop. It was necessary, of course,
to warn Sheiner, to exact a promise of better
living. But Blake&rsquo;s interest in the man had
already departed. He dropped him from his
scheme of things, once he had yielded up his
data. He tossed him aside like a sucked
orange, a smoked cigar, a burnt-out match.
Binhart, in all the movements of all the stellar
system, was the one name and the one man
that interested him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Loony Sheiner was still sitting at that table
in Antoine&rsquo;s when Blake, having wired his
messages to San Pedro and San Francisco,
caught the first train out of New Orleans.
As he sped across the face of the world, crawling
nearer and nearer the Pacific Coast, no
thought of the magnitude of that journey oppressed
him. His imagination remained untouched.
He neither fretted nor fumed at
the time this travel was taking. In spite of
the electric fans at each end of his Pullman,
it is true, he suffered greatly from the heat,
especially during the ride across the Arizona
Desert. He accepted it without complaint,
stolidly thanking his lucky stars that men
weren&rsquo;t still traveling across America&rsquo;s deserts
by ox-team. He was glad when he reached
the Colorado River and wound up into California,
leaving the alkali and sage brush and
yucca palms of the Mojave well behind him.
He was glad in his placid way when he reached
his hotel in San Francisco and washed the grit
and grime from his heat-nettled body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>But once that body had been bathed and
fed, he started on his rounds of the underworld,
seined the entire harbor-front without
effect, and then set out his night-lines as cautiously
as a fisherman in forbidden waters.
He did not overlook the shipping offices and
railway stations, neither did he neglect the
hotels and ferries. Then he quietly lunched
at Martenelli&rsquo;s with the much-honored but
most-uncomfortable Wolf Yonkholm, who
promptly suspended his &ldquo;dip&rdquo; operations at
the Beaches out of respect to Blake&rsquo;s sudden
call.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Nothing of moment, however, was learned
from the startled Wolf, and at Coppa&rsquo;s six
hours later, Blake dined with a Chink-smuggler
named Goldie Hopper. Goldie, after
his fifth glass of wine and an adroit decoying
of the talk along the channels which most interested
his portly host, casually announced
that an Eastern crook named Blanchard had
got away, the day before, on the Pacific mail
steamer <i>Manchuria</i>. He was clean shaven
and traveled as a clergyman. That struck
Goldie as the height of humor, a bank sneak
having the nerve to deck himself out as a
gospel-spieler.</p>
<p>His elucidation of it, however, brought no
answering smile from the diffident-eyed Blake,
who confessed that he was rounding up a
couple of nickel-coiners and would be going
East in a day or two.</p>
<p>Instead of going East, however, he hurriedly
consulted maps and timetables, found a
train that would land him in Portland in
twenty-six hours, and started north. He
could eventually save time, he found, by hastening
on to Seattle and catching a Great
Northern steamer from that port. When a
hot-box held his train up for over half an hour,
Blake stood with his timepiece in his hand,
watching the train crew in their efforts to
&ldquo;freeze the hub.&rdquo; They continued to lose
time, during the night. At Seattle, when he
reached the Great Northern docks, he found
that his steamer had sailed two hours before
he stepped from his sleeper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>His one remaining resource was a Canadian
Pacific steamer from Victoria. This, he figured
out, would get him to Hong Kong even
earlier than the steamer which he had already
missed. He had a hunch that Hong Kong
was the port he wanted. Just why, he could
not explain. But he felt sure that Binhart
would not drop off at Manila. Once on the
run, he would keep out of American quarters.
It was a gamble; it was a rough guess. But
then all life was that. And Blake had a
dogged and inarticulate faith in his &ldquo;hunches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crossing the Sound, he reached Victoria in
time to see the <i>Empress of China</i> under way,
and heading out to sea. Blake hired a tug
and overtook her. He reached the steamer&rsquo;s
deck by means of a Jacob&rsquo;s ladder that swung
along her side plates like a mason&rsquo;s plumbline
along a factory wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Binhart, he told himself, was by this time
in mid-Pacific, untold miles away, heading
for that vast and mysterious East into which
a man could so easily disappear. He was approaching
gloomy and tangled waterways that
threaded between islands which could not even
be counted. He was fleeing towards dark
rivers which led off through barbaric and
mysterious silence, into the heart of darkness.
He was drawing nearer and nearer to those
regions of mystery where a white man might
be swallowed up as easily as a rice grain is lost
in a shore lagoon. He would soon be in those
teeming alien cities as under-burrowed as a
gopher village.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>But Blake did not despair. Their whole
barbaric East, he told himself, was only a
Chinatown slum on a large scale. And he had
never yet seen the slum that remained forever
impervious to the right dragnet. He did not
know how or where the end would be. But
he knew there would be an end. He still
hugged to his bosom the placid conviction that
the world was small, that somewhere along the
frontiers of watchfulness the impact would be
recorded and the alarm would be given. A
man of Binhart&rsquo;s type, with the money Binhart
had, would never divorce himself completely
from civilization. He would always
crave a white man&rsquo;s world; he would always
hunger for what that world stood for and represented.
He would always creep back to it.
He might hide in his heathen burrow, for a
time; but there would be a limit to that exile.
A power stronger than his own will would
drive him back to his own land, back to civilization.
And civilization, to Blake, was merely
a rather large and rambling house equipped
with a rather efficient burglar-alarm system,
so that each time it was entered, early or late,
the tell-tale summons would eventually go to
the right quarter. And when the summons
came Blake would be waiting for it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<h2 id="c7">VII</h2>
<p>It was by wireless that Blake made what efforts
he could to confirm his suspicions that
Binhart had not dropped off at any port of
call between San Francisco and Hong Kong.
In due time the reply came back to &ldquo;Bishop
MacKishnie,&rdquo; on board the westbound <i>Empress
of China</i> that the Reverend Caleb Simpson
had safely landed from the <i>Manchuria</i> at
Hong Kong, and was about to leave for the
mission field in the interior.</p>
<p>The so-called bishop, sitting in the wireless-room
of the <i>Empress of China</i>, with a lacerated
black cigar between his teeth, received this
much relayed message with mixed feelings.
He proceeded to send out three Secret Service
code-despatches to Shanghai, Amoy and Hong
Kong, which, being picked up by a German
cruiser, were worried over and argued over and
finally referred back to an intelligence bureau
for explanation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>But at Yokohama, Blake hurried ashore in
a <i>sampan</i>, met an agent who seemed to be
awaiting him, and caught a train for Kobe.
He hurried on, indifferent to the beauties of
the country through which he wound, unimpressed
by the oddities of the civilization with
which he found himself confronted. His
mind, intent on one thing, seemed unable to
react to the stimuli of side-issues. From
Kobe he caught a <i>Toyo Kisen Kaisha</i> steamer
for Nagasaki and Shanghai. This steamer,
he found, lay over at the former port for thirteen
hours, so he shifted again to an outbound
boat headed for Woosung.</p>
<p>It was not until he was on the tender, making
the hour-long run from Woosung up the
Whangpoo to Shanghai itself, that he seemed
to emerge from his half-cataleptic indifference
to his environment. He began to realize
that he was at last in the Orient.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>As they wound up the river past sharp-nosed
and round-hooded sampans, and archaic
Chinese battle-ships and sea-going junks and
gunboats flying their unknown foreign flags,
Blake at last began to realize that he was in
a new world. The very air smelt exotic; the
very colors, the tints of the sails, the hues of
clothing, the forms of things, land and sky
itself&mdash;all were different. This depressed
him only vaguely. He was too intent on the
future, on the task before him, to give his
surroundings much thought.</p>
<p>Blake had entirely shaken off this vague
uneasiness, in fact, when twenty minutes after
landing he found himself in a red-brick hotel
known as The Astor, and guardedly shaking
hands with an incredulously thin and sallow-faced
man of about forty. Although this
man spoke with an English accent and exile
seemed to have foreigneered him in both appearance
and outlook, his knowledge of
America was active and intimate. He passed
over to the detective two despatches in cipher,
handed him a confidential list of Hong Kong
addresses, gave him certain information as to
Macao, and an hour later conducted him down
the river to the steamer which started that
night for Hong Kong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>As Blake trod that steamer&rsquo;s deck and
plowed on through strange seas, surrounded
by strange faces, intent on his strange chase,
no sense of vast adventure entered his soul.
No appreciation of a great hazard bewildered
his emotions. The kingdom of romance
dwells in the heart, in the heart roomy enough
to house it. And Blake&rsquo;s heart was taken up
with more material things. He was preoccupied
with his new list of addresses, with his
new lines of procedure, with the men he must
interview and the dives and clubs and bazars
he must visit. He had his day&rsquo;s work to do,
and he intended to do it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>The result was that of Hong Kong he carried
away no immediate personal impression,
beyond a vague jumble, in the background of
consciousness, of Buddhist temples and British
red-jackets, of stately parks and granite
buildings, of mixed nationalities and native
theaters, of anchored warships and a floating
city of houseboats. For it was the same hour
that he landed in this orderly and strangely
English city that the discovery he was drawing
close to Binhart again swept clean the slate
of his emotions. The response had come
from a consulate secretary. One wire in all
his sentinel network had proved a live one.
Binhart was not in Hong Kong, but he had
been seen in Macao; he was known to be still
there. And beyond that there was little that
Never-Fail Blake cared to know.</p>
<p>His one side-movement in Hong Kong was
to purchase an American revolver, for it began
to percolate even through his indurated
sensibilities that he was at last in a land where
his name might not be sufficiently respected
and his office sufficiently honored. For the
first time in seven long years he packed a gun,
he condescended to go heeled. Yet no minutest
tingle of excitement spread through his
lethargic body as he examined this gun, carefully
loaded it, and stowed it away in his
wallet-pocket. It meant no more to him than
the stowing away of a sandwich against the
emergency of a possible lost meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c8">VIII</h2>
<p>By the time he was on the noon boat that
left for Macao, Blake had quite forgotten
about the revolver. As he steamed southward
over smooth seas, threading a way
through boulder-strewn islands and skirting
mountainous cliffs, his movements seemed to
take on a sense of finality. He stood at the
rail, watching the hazy blue islands, the forests
of fishing-boats and high-pooped junks
floating lazily at anchor, the indolent figures
which he could catch glimpses of on deck, the
green waters of the China Sea. He watched
them with intent, yet abstracted, eyes. Some
echo of the witchery of those Eastern waters
at times penetrated his own preoccupied soul.
A vague sense of his remoteness from his old
life at last crept in to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>He thought of the watching green lights
that were flaring up, dusk by dusk, in the
shrill New York night, the lamps of the precinct
stations, the lamps of Headquarters,
where the great building was full of moving
feet and shifting faces, where telephones were
ringing and detectives were coming and going,
and policemen in uniform were passing up and
down the great stone steps, clean-cut, ruddy-faced,
strong-limbed policemen, talking and
laughing as they started out on their night details.
He could follow them as they went,
those confident-striding &ldquo;flatties&rdquo; with their
ash night-sticks at their side, soldiers without
bugles or banner, going out to do the goodly
tasks of the Law, soldiers of whom he was
once the leader, the pride, the man to whom
they pointed as the Vidoc of America.</p>
<p>And he would go back to them as great as
ever. He would again compel their admiration.
The newspaper boys would again come
filing into his office and shake hands with him
and smoke his cigars and ask how much he
could tell them about his last haul. And he
would recount to them how he shadowed Binhart
half way round the world, and gathered
him in, and brought him back to Justice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when
Blake&rsquo;s steamer drew near Macao. Against
a background of dim blue hills he could make
out the green and blue and white of the houses
in the Portuguese quarters, guarded on one
side by a lighthouse and on the other by a
stolid square fort. Swinging around a sharp
point, the boat entered the inner harbor,
crowded with Chinese craft and coasters and
dingy tramps of the sea.</p>
<p>Blake seemed in no hurry to disembark.
The sampan into which he stepped, in fact,
did not creep up to the shore until evening.
There, ignoring the rickshaw coolies who
awaited him as he passed an obnoxiously officious
trio of customs officers, he disappeared
up one of the narrow and slippery side streets
of the Chinese quarter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>He followed this street for some distance,
assailed by the smell of its mud and rotting
sewerage, twisting and turning deeper into the
darkness, past dogs and chattering coolies and
oil lamps and gaming-house doors. Into one
of these gaming houses he turned, passing
through the blackwood sliding door and climbing
the narrow stairway to the floor above.
There, from a small quadrangular gallery, he
could look down on the &ldquo;well&rdquo; of the fan-tan
lay out below.</p>
<p>He made his way to a seat at the rail, took
out a cigar, lighted it, and let his veiled gaze
wander about the place, point by point, until
he had inspected and weighed and appraised
every man in the building. He continued to
smoke, listlessly, like a sightseer with time on
his hands and in no mood for movement. The
brim of his black boulder shadowed his eyes.
His thumbs rested carelessly in the arm-holes
of his waistcoat. He lounged back torpidly,
listening to the drone and clatter of voices below,
lazily inspecting each newcomer, pretending
to drop off into a doze of ennui. But all
the while he was most acutely awake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>For somewhere in that gathering, he knew,
there was a messenger awaiting him.
Whether he was English or Portuguese, white
or yellow, Blake could not say. But from
some one there some word or signal was to come.</p>
<p>He peered down at the few white men in
the pit below. He watched the man at the
head of the carved blackwood table, beside his
heap of brass &ldquo;cash,&rdquo; watched him again and
again as he took up his handful of coins, covered
them with a brass hat while the betting
began, removed the hat, and seemed to be
dividing the pile, with the wand in his hand,
into fours. The last number of the last four,
apparently, was the object of the wagers.</p>
<p>Blake could not understand the game. It
puzzled him, just as the yellow men so stoically
playing it puzzled him, just as the entire
country puzzled him. Yet, obtuse as he was,
he felt the gulf of centuries that divided the
two races. These yellow men about him
seemed as far away from his humanity, as detached
from his manner of life and thought,
as were the animals he sometimes stared at
through the bars of the Bronx Zoo cages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>A white man would have to be pretty far
gone, Blake decided, to fall into their ways,
to be satisfied with the life of those yellow
men. He would have to be a terrible failure,
or he would have to be hounded by a terrible
fear, to live out his life so far away from his
own kind. And he felt now that Binhart
could never do it, that a life sentence there
would be worse than a life sentence to &ldquo;stir.&rdquo;
So he took another cigar, lighted it, and sat
back watching the faces about him.</p>
<p>For no apparent reason, and at no decipherable
sign, one of the yellow faces across the
smoke-filled room detached itself from its fellows.
This face showed no curiosity, no
haste. Blake watched it as it calmly approached
him. He watched until he felt a
finger against his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You clum b&rsquo;long me,&rdquo; was the enigmatic
message uttered in the detective&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I go along with you?&rdquo; Blake
calmly inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You clum b&rsquo;long me,&rdquo; reiterated the
Chinaman. The finger again touched the detective&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;Clismas!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Blake rose, at once. He recognized the
code word of &ldquo;Christmas.&rdquo; This was the
messenger he had been awaiting.</p>
<p>He followed the figure down the narrow
stairway, through the sliding door, out into
the many-odored street, foul with refuse, bisected
by its open sewer of filth, took a turning
into a still narrower street, climbed a precipitous
hill cobbled with stone, turned still
again, always overshadowed and hemmed in
by tall houses close together, with black-beamed
lattice doors through which he could
catch glimpses of gloomy interiors. He
turned again down a wooden-walled hallway
that reminded him of a Mott Street burrow.
When the Chinaman touched him on the sleeve
he came to a stop.</p>
<p>His guide was pointing to a closed door in
front of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sabby?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Blake hesitated. He had no idea of what
was behind that door, but he gathered from
the Chinaman&rsquo;s motion that he was to enter.
Before he could turn to make further inquiry
the Chinaman had slipped away like a shadow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<h2 id="c9">IX</h2>
<p>Blake stood regarding the door. Then
he lifted his revolver from his breast
pocket and dropped it into his side pocket,
with his hand on the butt. Then with his left
hand he quietly opened the door, pushed it
back, and as quietly stepped into the room.</p>
<p>On the floor, in the center of a square of
orange-colored matting, he saw a white
woman sitting. She was drinking tea out of
an egg-shell of a cup, and after putting down
the cup she would carefully massage her lips
with the point of her little finger. This movement
puzzled the newcomer until he suddenly
realized that it was merely to redistribute the
rouge on them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>She was dressed in a silk petticoat of almost
lemon yellow and an azure-colored silk bodice
that left her arms and shoulders bare to the
light that played on them from three small
oil lamps above her. Her feet and ankles
were also bare, except for the matting sandals
into which her toes were thrust. On one thin
arm glimmered an extraordinarily heavy
bracelet of gold. Her skin, which was very
white, was further albificated by a coat of rice
powder. She was startlingly slight. Blake,
as he watched her, could see the oval shadows
under her collar bones and the almost girlish
meagerness of breast half-covered by the azure
silk bodice.</p>
<p>She looked up slowly as Blake stepped into
the room. Her eyes widened, and she continued
to look, with parted lips, as she
contemplated the intruder&rsquo;s heavy figure.
There was no touch of fear on her face. It
was more curiosity, the wilful, wide-eyed
curiosity of the child. She even laughed a
little as she stared at the intruder. Her
rouged lips were tinted a carmine so bright
that they looked like a wound across her white
face. That gash of color became almost
clown-like as it crescented upward with its
wayward mirth. Her eyebrows were heavily
penciled and the lids of the eyes elongated by
a widening point of blue paint. Her bare
heel, which she caressed from time to time with
fingers whereon the nails were stained pink
with henna, was small and clean cut, as clean
cut, Blake noticed, as the heel of a razor, while
the white calf above it was as thin and flat as
a boy&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, New York,&rdquo; she said with her
foolish and inconsequential little laugh. Her
voice took on an oddly exotic intonation, as
she spoke. Her teeth were small and white;
they reminded Blake of rice, while she repeated
the &ldquo;New York,&rdquo; bubblingly, as though
she were a child with a newly learned word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; responded the detective, wondering
how or where to begin. She made him
think of a painted marionette, so maintained
were her poses, so unreal was her make up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the party who&rsquo;s on the man hunt,&rdquo;
she announced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; equivocated Blake. She had risen
to her feet by this time, with monkey-like
agility, and showed herself to be much taller
than he had imagined. He noticed a knife
scar on her forearm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re after this man called Binhart,&rdquo; she
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s sagacious
response. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want Binhart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the money he&rsquo;s got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little painted face grew serious; then
it became veiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much money has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to find out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She squatted ruminatively down on the edge
of her divan. It was low and wide and covered
with orange-colored silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll have to find Binhart!&rdquo; was
her next announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe!&rdquo; acknowledged Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can show you where he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was the unperturbed response.
The blue-painted eyes were studying him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be worth four thousand pounds, in
English gold,&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>Blake took a step or two nearer her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the message Ottenheim told you to
give me?&rdquo; he demanded. His face was red
with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then three thousand pounds,&rdquo; she calmly
suggested, wriggling her toes into a fallen
sandal.</p>
<p>Blake did not deign to speak. His inarticulate
grunt was one of disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then a thousand, in gold,&rdquo; she coyly intimated.
She twisted about to pull the strap
of her bodice up over her white shoulder-blades.
&ldquo;Or I will kill him for you for two
thousand pounds in gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were as tranquil as a child&rsquo;s.
Blake remembered that he was in a world not
his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I want him killed?&rdquo; he inquired.
He looked about for some place to
sit. There was not a chair in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he intends to kill <i>you</i>,&rdquo; answered
the woman, squatting on the orange-covered
divan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d come and try,&rdquo; Blake devoutly
retorted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He will not come,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;It will
be done from the dark. <i>I</i> could have done it.
But Ottenheim said no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ottenheim said you were to work with
me in this,&rdquo; declared Blake, putting two and
two together.</p>
<p>The woman shrugged a white shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any money?&rdquo; she asked. She
put the question with the artlessness of a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty little,&rdquo; retorted Blake, still studying
the woman from where he stood. He was
wondering if Ottenheim had the same hold on
her that the authorities had on Ottenheim, the
ex-forger who enjoyed his parole only on condition
that he remain a stool-pigeon of the
high seas. He pondered what force he could
bring to bear on her, what power could squeeze
from those carmine and childish lips the information
he must have.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>He knew that he could break that slim body
of hers across his knee. But he also knew
that he had no way of crushing out of it the
truth he sought, the truth he must in some way
obtain. The woman still squatted on the
divan, peering down at the knife scar on her
arm from time to time, studying it, as though
it were an inscription.</p>
<p>Blake was still watching the woman when
the door behind him was slowly opened; a head
was thrust in, and as quietly withdrawn again.
Blake dropped his right hand to his coat
pocket and moved further along the wall,
facing the woman. There was nothing of
which he stood afraid: he merely wished to be
on the safe side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what word&rsquo;ll I take back to Ottenheim?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>The woman grew serious. Then she
showed her rice-like row of teeth as she
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means there&rsquo;s nothing in it for me,&rdquo;
she complained with pouting-lipped moroseness.
Her venality, he began to see, was
merely the instinctive acquisitiveness of the
savage, the greed of the petted child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No more than there is for me,&rdquo; Blake
acknowledged. She turned and caught up a
heavily flowered mandarin coat of plaited
cream and gold. She was thrusting one arm
into it when a figure drifted into the room
from the matting-hung doorway on Blake&rsquo;s
left. As she saw this figure she suddenly
flung off the coat and stooped to the tea tray
in the middle of the floor.</p>
<p>Blake saw that the newcomer was a Chinaman.
This newcomer, he also saw, ignored
him as though he were a door post, confronting
the woman and assailing her with a quick
volley of words, of incomprehensible words in
the native tongue. She answered with the
same clutter and clack of unknown syllables,
growing more and more excited as the dialogue
continued. Her thin face darkened and
changed, her white arms gyrated, the fires of
anger burned in the baby-like eyes. She
seemed expostulating, arguing, denouncing,
and each wordy sally was met by an equally
wordy sally from the Chinaman. She challenged
and rebuked with her passionately
pointed finger; she threatened with angry
eyes; she stormed after the newcomer as he
passed like a shadow out of the room; she met
him with a renewed storm when he returned a
moment later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>The Chinaman now stood watching her, impassive
and immobile, as though he had taken
his stand and intended to stick to it. Blake
studied him with calm and patient eyes. That
huge-limbed detective in his day had
&ldquo;pounded&rdquo; too many Christy Street Chinks
to be in any way intimidated by a queue and
a yellow face. He was not disturbed. He
was merely puzzled.</p>
<p>Then the woman turned to the mandarin
coat, and caught it up, shook it out, and for
one brief moment stood thoughtfully regarding
it. Then she suddenly turned about on
the Chinaman.</p>
<p>Blake, as he stood watching that renewed
angry onslaught, paid little attention to the
actual words that she was calling out. But as
he stood there he began to realize that she was
not speaking in Chinese, but in English.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear me, white man? Do you hear
me?&rdquo; she cried out, over and over again. Yet
the words seemed foolish, for all the time as
she uttered them, she was facing the placid-eyed
Chinaman and gesticulating in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; Blake at last heard her
crying, &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m saying!
He doesn&rsquo;t understand a word of English!&rdquo;
And then, and then only, it dawned on Blake
that every word the woman was uttering
was intended for his own ears. She was
warning him, and all the while pretending
that her words were the impetuous words of
anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch this man!&rdquo; he heard her cry.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him know you&rsquo;re listening. But
remember what I say, remember it. And God
help you if you haven&rsquo;t got a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake could see her, as in a dream, assailing
the Chinaman with her gestures, advancing on
him, threatening him, expostulating with him,
but all in pantomime. There was something
absurd about it, as absurd as a moving-picture
film which carries the wrong text.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll pretend to take you to the man you
want,&rdquo; the woman was panting. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what he will say. But it&rsquo;s a lie. He&rsquo;ll take
you out to a sampan, to put you aboard Binhart&rsquo;s
boat. But the three of them will cut
your throat, cut your throat, and then drop
you overboard. He&rsquo;s to get so much in gold.
Get out of here with him. Let him think
you&rsquo;re going. But drop away, somewhere,
before you get to the beach. And watch
them all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake stared at the immobile Chinaman, as
though to make sure that the other man had
not understood. He was still staring at that
impassive yellow face, he was still absorbing
the shock of his news, when the outer door
opened and a second Chinaman stepped into
the room. The newcomer cluttered a quick
sentence or two to his countryman, and was
still talking when a third figure sidled in.</p>
<p>Those spoken words, whatever they were,
seemed to have little effect on any one in the
room except the woman. She suddenly
sprang about and exploded into an angry
shower of denials.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; she cried in English, storming
about the impassive trio. &ldquo;You never heard
me peach! You never heard me say a word!
It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake strode to the middle of the room,
towering above the other figures, dwarfing
them by his great bulk, as assured of his mastery
as he would have been in a Chatham
Square gang fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row here?&rdquo; he thundered,
knowing from the past that power promptly
won its own respect. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you talking
about, you two?&rdquo; He turned from one intruder
to another. &ldquo;And you? And you?
What do you want, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three contending figures, however, ignored
him as though he were a tobacconist&rsquo;s
dummy. They went on with their exotic
cackle, as though he was no longer in their
midst. They did not so much as turn an eye
in his direction. And still Blake felt reasonably
sure of his position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>It was not until the woman squeaked, like a
frightened mouse, and ran whimpering into
the corner of the room, that he realized what
was happening. He was not familiar with
the wrist movement by which the smallest
bodied of the three men was producing a knife
from his sleeve. The woman, however, had
understood from the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White man, look out!&rdquo; she half sobbed
from her corner. &ldquo;Oh, white man!&rdquo; she repeated
in a shriller note as the Chinaman,
bending low, scuttled across the room to the
corner where she cowered.</p>
<p>Blake saw the knife by this time. It was
thin and long, for all the world like an icicle,
a shaft of cutting steel ground incredibly thin,
so thin, in fact, that at first sight it looked
more like a point for stabbing than a blade for
cutting.</p>
<p>The mere glitter of that knife electrified the
staring white man into sudden action. He
swung about and tried to catch at the arm that
held the steel icicle. He was too late for that,
but his fingers closed on the braided queue.
By means of this queue he brought the Chinaman
up short, swinging him sharply about so
that he collided flat faced with the room
wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Then, for the first time, Blake grew into a
comprehension of what surrounded him. He
wheeled about, stooped and caught up the
papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; tea-tray from the floor and once
more stood with his back to the wall. He
stood there, on guard, for a second figure with
a second steel icicle was sidling up to him. He
swung viciously out and brought the tea-tray
down on the hand that held this knife, crippling
the fingers and sending the steel spinning
across the room. Then with his free hand
he tugged the revolver from his coat pocket,
holding it by the barrel and bringing the metal
butt down on the queue-wound head of the
third man, who had no knife, but was struggling
with the woman for the metal icicle she
had caught up from the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Then the five seemed to close in together,
and the fight became general. It became a
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. With his swinging right arm Blake
battered and pounded with his revolver butt.
With his left hand he made cutting strokes
with the heavy papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; tea-tray, keeping
their steel, by those fierce sweeps, away
from his body. One Chinaman he sent
sprawling, leaving him huddled and motionless
against the orange-covered divan. The
second, stunned by a blow of the tea-tray
across the eyes, could offer no resistance when
Blake&rsquo;s smashing right dealt its blow, the
metal gun butt falling like a trip hammer on
the shaved and polished skull.</p>
<p>As the white man swung about he saw the
third Chinaman with his hand on the woman&rsquo;s
throat, holding her flat against the wall, placing
her there as a butcher might place a fowl
on his block ready for the blow of his carver.
Blake stared at the movement, panting for
breath, overcome by that momentary indifference
wherein a winded athlete permits without
protest an adversary to gain his momentary
advantage. Then will triumphed over the
weakness of the body. But before Blake
could get to the woman&rsquo;s side he saw the Chinaman&rsquo;s
loose-sleeved right hand slowly and deliberately
ascend. As it reached the meridian
of its circular upsweep he could see the woman
rise on her toes, rise as though with some quick
effort, yet some effort which Blake could not
understand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>At the same moment that she did so a look
of pained expostulation crept into the staring
slant eyes on a level with her own. The yellow
jaw gaped, filled with blood, and the
poised knife fell at his side, sticking point
down in the flooring. The azure and lemon-yellow
that covered the woman&rsquo;s body flamed
into sudden scarlet. It was only as the figure
with the expostulating yellow face sank to the
ground, crumpling up on itself as it fell, that
Blake comprehended. That quick sweep of
scarlet, effacing the azure and lemon, had
come from the sudden deluge of blood that
burst over the woman&rsquo;s body. She had made
use of the upstroke, Mexican style. Her
knife had cut the full length of the man&rsquo;s abdominal
cavity, clean and straight to the
breastbone. He had been ripped up like a
herring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Blake panted and wheezed, not at the sight
of the blood, but at the exertion to which his
flabby muscles had been put. His body was
moist with sweat. His asthmatic throat
seemed stifling his lungs. A faint nausea
crept through him, a dim ventral revolt at the
thought that such things could take place so
easily, and with so little warning.</p>
<p>His breast still heaved and panted and he
was still fighting for breath when he saw the
woman stoop and wipe the knife on one of the
fallen Chinaman&rsquo;s sleeves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get out of here!&rdquo; she whimpered,
as she caught up the mandarin coat and
flung it over her shoulders, for in the struggle
her body had been bared almost to the waist.
Blake saw the crimson that dripped on her
matting slippers and maculated the cream
white of the mandarin coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s Binhart?&rdquo; he demanded, as
he looked stolidly about for his black boulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind Binhart,&rdquo; she cried, touching
the eviscerated body at her feet with one slipper
toe, &ldquo;or we&rsquo;ll get what <i>he</i> got!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want that man Binhart!&rdquo; persisted the
detective.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not here! Not here!&rdquo; she cried, folding
the loose folds of the cloak closer about her
body.</p>
<p>She ran to the matting curtain, looked out,
and called back, &ldquo;Quick! Come quick!&rdquo;
Then she ran back, slipped the bolt in the
outer door and rejoined the waiting detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, white man!&rdquo; she gasped, as the matting
fell between them and the room incarnadined
by their struggle. Blake was not sure,
but he thought he heard her giggle, hysterically,
in the darkness. They were groping
their way along a narrow passage. They
slipped through a second door, closed and
locked it after them, and once more groped
on through the darkness.</p>
<p>How many turns they took, Blake could
not remember. She stopped and whispered
to him to go softly, as they came to a stairway,
as steep and dark as a cistern. Blake, at the
top, could smell opium smoke, and once or
twice he thought he heard voices. The woman
stopped him, with outstretched arms, at the
stair head, and together they stood and
listened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Blake, with nerves taut, waited for some
sign from her to go on again. He thought she
was giving it, when he felt a hand caress his
side. He felt it move upward, exploringly.
At the same time that he heard her little groan
of alarm he knew that the hand was not hers.</p>
<p>He could not tell what the darkness held,
but his movement was almost instinctive. He
swung out with his great arm, countered on
the crouching form in front of him, caught at
a writhing shoulder, and tightening his grip,
sent the body catapulting down the stairway
at his side. He could hear a revolver go off
as the body went tumbling and rolling down&mdash;Blake
knew that it was a gun not his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, white man!&rdquo; the girl in front of
him was crying, as she tugged at his coat.
And they went on, now at a run, taking a turn
to the right, making a second descent, and
then another to the left. They came to still
another door, which they locked behind them.
Then they scrambled up a ladder, and he could
hear her quick hands padding about in the
dark. A moment later she had thrust up a
hatch. He saw it led to the open air, for the
stars were above them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>He felt grateful for that open air, for the
coolness, for the sense of deliverance which
came with even that comparative freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; she whispered. And he followed
her across the slant of the uneven roof.
He was weak for want of breath. The girl
had to catch him and hold him for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the next roof you must take off your
shoes,&rdquo; she warned him. &ldquo;You can rest then.
But hurry&mdash;hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gulped down the fresh air as he tore at
his shoe laces, thrusting each shoe in a side
pocket as he started after her. For by this
time she was scrambling across the broken
sloping roofs, as quick and agile as a cat, dropping
over ledges, climbing up barriers and
across coping tiles. Where she was leading
him he had no remotest idea. She reminded
him of a cream-tinted monkey in the maddest
of steeplechases. He was glad when she came
to a stop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>The town seemed to lay to their right. Before
them were the scattered lights of the harbor
and the mild crescent of the outer bay.
They could see the white wheeling finger of
some foreign gunboat as its searchlight played
back and forth in the darkness.</p>
<p>She sighed with weariness and dropped
cross-legged down on the coping tiles against
which he leaned, regaining his breath. She
squatted there, cooingly, like a child exhausted
with its evening games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dished!&rdquo; she murmured, as she sat
there breathing audibly through the darkness.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dished for this coast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down beside her, staring at the searchlight.
There seemed something reassuring,
something authoritative and comforting, in the
thought of it watching there in the darkness.</p>
<p>The girl touched him on the knee and then
shifted her position on the coping tiles, without
rising to her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; she commanded. And when
he was close beside her she pointed with her
thin white arm. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Saint Poalo there&mdash;you
can just make it out, up high, see. And
those lights are the Boundary Gate. And this
sweep of lights below here is the <i>Praya</i>. Now
look where I&rsquo;m pointing. That&rsquo;s the Luiz
Camoes lodging-house. You see the second
window with the light in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Binhart&rsquo;s inside that window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; said Blake, staring at the
vague square of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s there, all right. He&rsquo;s posing
as a buyer for a tea house, and calls himself
Bradley. Lee Fu told me; and Lee Fu is always
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood up and pulled the mandarin coat
closer about her thin body. The coolness of
the night air had already chilled her. Then
she squinted carefully about in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get Binhart,&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>He could hear her little childlike murmur of
laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re brave, white man,&rdquo; she said, with
a hand on his arm. She was silent for a moment,
before she added: &ldquo;And I think you&rsquo;ll
get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll get him,&rdquo; retorted Blake,
buttoning his coat. The fires had been relighted
on the cold hearth of his resolution.
It came to him only as an accidental afterthought
that he had met an unknown woman
and had passed through strange adventures
with her and was now about to pass out of her
life again, forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Again he heard the careless little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll slip down through the Quarter and
cop some clothes somewhere. Then I&rsquo;ll have
a sampan take me out to the German boat.
It&rsquo;ll start for Canton at daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; asked Blake, watching the window
of the Luiz Camoes lodging-house below
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll work my way up to Port Arthur,
I suppose. There&rsquo;s a navy man there who&rsquo;ll
help me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any money?&rdquo; Blake put the
question a little uneasily.</p>
<p>Again he felt the careless coo of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel!&rdquo; she said. She caught his huge hand
between hers and pressed it against her waist
line. She rubbed his fingers along what he
accepted as a tightly packed coin-belt. He
was relieved to think that he would not have
to offer her money. Then he peered over the
coping tiles to make sure of his means of descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better go first,&rdquo; she said, as she
leaned out and looked down at his side. &ldquo;Crawl
down this next roof to the end there. At the
corner, see, is the end of the ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped and slipped his feet into his
shoes. Then he let himself cautiously down to
the adjoining roof, steeper even than the
one on which they had stood. She bent
low over the tiles, so that her face was very
close to his as he found his footing and stood
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, white man,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; he whispered back, as he worked
his way cautiously and ponderously along that
perilous slope.</p>
<p>She leaned there, watching him as he gained
the ladder-end. He did not look back as he
lowered himself, rung by rung. All thought
of her, in fact, had passed from his preoccupied
mind. He was once more intent on his own
grim ends. He was debating with himself just
how he was to get in through that lodging-house
window and what his final move would be
for the round up of his enemy. He had made
use of too many &ldquo;molls&rdquo; in his time to waste
useless thought on what they might say or do or
desire. When he had got Binhart, he remembered,
he would have to look about for something
to eat, for he was as hungry as a wolf.
And he did not even hear the girl&rsquo;s second soft
whisper of &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c10">X</h2>
<p>That stolid practicality which had made
Blake a successful operative asserted
itself in the matter of his approach to the Luiz
Camoes house, the house which had been
pointed out to him as holding Binhart.</p>
<p>He circled promptly about to the front of
that house, pressed a gold coin in the hand of
the half-caste Portuguese servant who opened
the door, and asked to be shown to the room
of the English tea merchant.</p>
<p>That servant, had he objected, would have
been promptly taken possession of by the detective,
and as promptly put in a condition
where he could do no harm, for Blake felt that
he was too near the end of his trail to be put
off by any mere side issue. But the coin and
the curt explanation that the merchant must be
seen at once admitted Blake to the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>The servant was leading him down the length
of the half-lit hall when Blake caught him by
the sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell my rickshaw boy to wait! Quick,
before he gets away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake knew that the last door would be the
one leading to Binhart&rsquo;s room. The moment
he was alone in the hall he tiptoed to this door
and pressed an ear against its panel. Then
with his left hand, he slowly turned the knob,
caressing it with his fingers that it might not
click when the latch was released. As he had
feared, it was locked.</p>
<p>He stood for a second or two, thinking.
Then with the knuckle of one finger he tapped
on the door, lightly, almost timidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>A man&rsquo;s voice from within cried out, &ldquo;Wait
a minute! Wait a minute!&rdquo; But Blake, who
had been examining the woodwork of the door-frame,
did not choose to wait a minute. Any
such wait, he felt, would involve too much risk.
In one minute, he knew, a fugitive could either
be off and away, or could at least prepare himself
for any one intercepting that flight. So
Blake took two quick steps back, and brought
his massive shoulder against the door. It
swung back, as though nothing more than a
parlor match had held it shut. Blake, as he
stepped into the room, dropped his right hand
to his coat pocket.</p>
<p>Facing him, at the far side of the room, he
saw Binhart.</p>
<p>The fugitive sat in a short-legged reed chair,
with a grip-sack open on his knees. His coat
and vest were off, and the light from the oil
lamp at his side made his linen shirt a blotch
of white.</p>
<p>He had thrown his head up, at the sound of
the opening door, and he still sat, leaning forward
in the low chair in an attitude of startled
expectancy. There was no outward and apparent
change on his face as his eyes fell on
Blake&rsquo;s figure. He showed neither fear nor
bewilderment. His career had equipped him
with histrionic powers that were exceptional.
As a bank-sneak and confidence-man he had
long since learned perfect control of his features,
perfect composure even under the most
discomforting circumstances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Connie!&rdquo; said the detective facing
him. He spoke quietly, and his attitude
seemed one of unconcern. Yet a careful observer
might have noticed that the pulse of his
beefy neck was beating faster than usual. And
over that great body, under its clothing, were
rippling tremors strangely like those that shake
the body of a leashed bulldog at the sight of a
street cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jim!&rdquo; answered Binhart, with equal
composure. He had aged since Blake had last
seen him, aged incredibly. His face was thin
now, with plum-colored circles under the faded
eyes.</p>
<p>He made a move as though to lift down the
valise that rested on his knees. But Blake
stopped him with a sharp movement of his
right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Binhart eyed him. During that few seconds
of silent tableau each man was appraising,
weighing, estimating the strength of the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Jim?&rdquo; asked Binhart,
almost querulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want that gun you&rsquo;ve got up there under
your liver pad,&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s impassive answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Binhart. But he made
no move to produce the gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I want you,&rdquo; calmly announced
Blake.</p>
<p>A look of gentle expostulation crept over
Binhart&rsquo;s gaunt face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it, Jim,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t take me away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to,&rdquo; retorted Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to take you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crossed the room as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the gun,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>Binhart still sat in the low reed chair. He
made no movement in response to Blake&rsquo;s command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of getting rough-house,&rdquo;
he complained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gi&rsquo; me the gun,&rdquo; repeated Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, I hate to see you act this way,&rdquo; but
as Binhart spoke he slowly drew the revolver
from its flapped pocket. Blake&rsquo;s revolver barrel
was touching the white shirt-front as the
movement was made. It remained there until
he had possession of Binhart&rsquo;s gun. Then he
backed away, putting his own revolver back in
his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, get your clothes on,&rdquo; commanded
Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; temporized Binhart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it, Jim,&rdquo; persisted the other.
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t get me down to the water-front,
in this town. They&rsquo;d get you before
you were two hundred yards away from that
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it,&rdquo; announced the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d fight you myself, every move.
This ain&rsquo;t Manhattan Borough, you know,
Jim; you can&rsquo;t kidnap a white man. I&rsquo;d have
you in irons for abduction the first ship we
struck. And at the first port of call I&rsquo;d have
the best law sharps money could get. You
can&rsquo;t do it, Jim. It ain&rsquo;t law!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What t&rsquo; hell do I care for law,&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s
retort. &ldquo;I want you and you&rsquo;re going to come
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Binhart laughed. It was a laugh without
any mirth in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, you&rsquo;re foolish. You couldn&rsquo;t get
me back to New York alive, any more than you
could take Victoria Peak to New York!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, I&rsquo;ll take you along the
other way, if I ain&rsquo;t going to take you alive.
I&rsquo;ve followed you a good many thousand
miles, Connie, and a little loose talk ain&rsquo;t going
to make me lie down at this stage of the
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Binhart sat studying the other man for a
moment or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how about a little real talk, the kind
of talk that money makes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; declared Blake, folding his
arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Binhart flickered a glance at him as he
thrust his own right hand down into the hand-bag
on his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to show you what you could get out
of this,&rdquo; he said, leaning forward a little as he
looked up at Blake.</p>
<p>When his exploring right hand was lifted
again above the top of the bag Blake firmly
expected to see papers of some sort between
its fingers. He was astonished to see something
metallic, something which glittered
bright in the light from the wall lamp. The
record of this discovery had scarcely been carried
back to his brain, when the silence of the
room seemed to explode into a white sting, a
puff of noise that felt like a whip lash curling
about Blake&rsquo;s leg. It seemed to roll off in a
shifting and drifting cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>It so amazed Blake that he fell back against
the wall, trying to comprehend it, to decipher
the source and meaning of it all. He was still
huddled back against the wall when a second
surprise came to him. It was the discovery
that Binhart had caught up a hat and a coat,
and was running away, running out through
the door while his captor stared after him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>It was only then Blake realized that his
huddled position was not a thing of his own volition.
Some impact had thrown him against
the wall like a toppled nine-pin. The truth
came to him, in a sudden flash; Binhart had
shot at him. There had been a second revolver
hidden away in the hand bag, and Binhart
had attempted to make use of it.</p>
<p>A great rage against Binhart swept through
him. A still greater rage at the thought that
his enemy was running away brought Blake
lurching and scrambling to his feet. He was
a little startled to find that it hurt him to run.
But it hurt him more to think of losing Binhart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>He dove for the door, hurling his great bulk
through it, tossing aside the startled Portuguese
servant who stood at the outer entrance.
He ran frenziedly out into the night, knowing
by the staring faces of the street-corner group
that Binhart had made the first turning and
was running towards the water-front. He
could see the fugitive, as he came to the corner;
and like an unpenned bull he swung about and
made after him. His one thought was to capture
his man. His one obsession was to haul
down Binhart.</p>
<p>Then, as he ran, a small trouble insinuated
itself into his mind. He could not understand
the swishing of his right boot, at every hurrying
stride. But he did not stop, for he could
already smell the odorous coolness of the water-front
and he knew he must close in on his man
before that forest of floating sampans and native
house-boats swallowed him up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>A lightheadedness crept over him as he came
panting down to the water&rsquo;s edge. The faces
of the coolies about him, as he bargained for a
sampan, seemed far away and misty. The
voices, as the flat-bottomed little skiff was
pushed off in pursuit of the boat which was
hurrying Binhart out into the night, seemed
remote and thin, as though coming from across
foggy water. He was bewildered by a sense
of dampness in his right leg. He patted it
with his hand, inquisitively, and found it wet.
He stooped down and felt his boot. It was
full of blood. It was overrunning with blood.
He remembered then. Binhart had shot him,
after all.</p>
<p>He could never say whether it was this discovery,
or the actual loss of blood, that filled
him with a sudden giddiness. He fell forward
on his face, on the bottom of the rocking
sampan.</p>
<p>He must have been unconscious for some
time, for when he awakened he was dimly
aware that he was being carried up the landing-ladder
of a steamer. He heard English
voices about him. A very youthful-looking
ship&rsquo;s surgeon came and bent over him, cut
away his trouser-leg, and whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s been bleeding like a stuck pig!&rdquo;
he heard a startled voice, very close to him,
suddenly exclaim. And a few minutes later,
after being moved again, he opened his eyes
to find himself in a berth and the boyish-looking
surgeon assuring him it was all
right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Binhart?&rdquo; asked Blake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, old chap, you just rest
up a bit,&rdquo; said the placatory youth.</p>
<p>At nine the next morning Blake was taken
ashore at Hong Kong.</p>
<p>After eleven days in the English hospital
he was on his feet again. He was quite strong
by that time. But for several weeks after
that his leg was painfully stiff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h2 id="c11">XI</h2>
<p>Twelve days later Blake began just
where he had left off. He sent out his
feelers, he canvassed the offices from which
some echo might come, he had Macao searched,
and all westbound steamers which he could
reach by wireless were duly warned. But
more than ever, now, he found, he had to depend
on his own initiative, his own personal
efforts. The more official the quarters to
which he looked for cooperation, the less response
he seemed to elicit. In some circles, he
saw, his story was even doubted. It was listened
to with indifference; it was dismissed
with shrugs. There were times when he himself
was smiled at, pityingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>He concluded, after much thought on the
matter, that Binhart would continue to work
his way westward. That the fugitive would
strike inland and try to reach Europe by means
of the Trans-Siberian Railway seemed out of
the question. On that route he would be too
easily traced. The carefully guarded frontiers
of Russia, too, would offer obstacles which he
dare not meet. He would stick to the ragged
and restless sea-fringes, concluded the detective.
But before acting on that conclusion he
caught a <i>Toyo Kisen Kaisha</i> steamer for
Shanghai, and went over that city from the
Bund and the Maloo to the narrowest street
in the native quarter. In all this second search,
however, he found nothing to reward his efforts.
So he started doggedly southward
again, stopping at Saigon and Bangkok and
Singapore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>At each of these ports he went through the
same rounds, canvassed the same set of officials,
and made the same inquiries. Then he
would go to the native quarters, to the gambling
houses, to the water-front and the rickshaw
coolies and half-naked Malay wharf-rats,
holding the departmental photograph of Binhart
in his hand and inquiring of stranger
after stranger: &ldquo;You know? You savvy
him?&rdquo; And time after time the curious yellow
faces would bend over the picture, the inscrutable
slant eyes would study the face, sometimes
silently, sometimes with a disheartening
jabber of heathen tongues. But not one
trace of Binhart could he pick up.</p>
<p>Then he went on to Penang. There he went
doggedly through the same man&oelig;uvers, canvassing
the same rounds and putting the same
questions. And it was at Penang that a sharp-eyed
young water-front coolie squinted at the
well-thumbed photograph, squinted back at
Blake, and shook his head in affirmation. A
tip of a few English shillings loosened his
tongue, but as Blake understood neither Malay
nor Chinese he was in the dark until he led his
coolie to a Cook&rsquo;s agent, who in turn called
in the local officers, who in turn consulted with
the booking-agents of the P. &amp; O. Line. It
was then Blake discovered that Binhart had
booked passage under the name of Blaisdell,
twelve days before, for Brindisi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Blake studied the map, cashed a draft, and
waited for the next steamer. While marking
time he purchased copies of &ldquo;French Self-Taught&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Italian Self-Taught,&rdquo; hoping to
school himself in a speaking knowledge of these
two tongues. But the effort was futile. Pore
as he might over those small volumes, he could
glean nothing from their laboriously pondered
pages. His mind was no longer receptive. It
seemed indurated, hard-shelled. He had to acknowledge
to his own soul that it was beyond
him. He was too old a dog to learn new
tricks.</p>
<p>The trip to Brindisi seemed an endless one.
He seemed to have lost his earlier tendency to
be a &ldquo;mixer.&rdquo; He became more morose, more
self-immured. He found himself without the
desire to make new friends, and his Celtic ancestry
equipped him with a mute and sullen
antipathy for his aggressively English fellow
travelers. He spent much of his time in the
smoking-room, playing solitaire. When they
stopped at Madras and Bombay he merely
emerged from his shell to make sure if no
trace of Binhart were about. He was no more
interested in these heathen cities of a heathen
East than in an ash-pile through which he
might have to rake for a hidden coin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>By the time he reached Brindisi he had recovered
his lost weight, and added to it, by
many pounds. He had also returned to his
earlier habit of chewing &ldquo;fine-cut.&rdquo; He gave
less thought to his personal appearance, becoming
more and more indifferent as to the impression
he made on those about him. His
face, for all his increase in flesh, lost its ruddiness.
It was plain that during the last few
months he had aged, that his hound-like eye had
grown more haggard, that his always ponderous
step had lost the last of its resilience.</p>
<p>Yet one hour after he had landed at Brindisi
his listlessness seemed a thing of the past.
For there he was able to pick up the trail
again, with clear proof that a man answering
to Binhart&rsquo;s description had sailed for Corfu.
From Corfu the scent was followed northward
to Ragusa, and from Ragusa, on to Trieste,
where it was lost again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Two days of hard work, however, convinced
Blake that Binhart had sailed from Fiume to
Naples. He started southward by train, at
once, vaguely surprised at the length of Italy,
vaguely disconcerted by the unknown tongue
and the unknown country which he had to face.</p>
<p>It was not until he arrived at Naples that he
seemed to touch solid ground again. That
city, he felt, stood much nearer home. In it
were many persons not averse to curry favor
with a New York official, and many persons
indirectly in touch with the home Department.
These persons he assiduously sought out, one
by one, and in twelve hours&rsquo; time his net had
been woven completely about the city. And,
so far as he could learn, Binhart was still somewhere
in that city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Two days later, when least expecting it, he
stepped into the wine-room of an obscure little
pension hotel on the Via Margellina and saw
Binhart before him. Binhart left the room
as the other man stepped into it. He left by
way of the window, carrying the casement with
him. Blake followed, but the lighter and
younger man out-ran him and was swallowed
up by one of the unknown streets of an unknown
quarter. An hour later Blake had his
hired agents raking that quarter from cellar to
garret. It was not until the evening of the
following day that these agents learned Binhart
had made his way to the Marina, bribed
a water-front boatman to row him across the
bay, and had been put aboard a freighter
weighing anchor for Marseilles.</p>
<p>For the second time Blake traversed Italy
by train, hurrying self-immured and preoccupied
through Rome and Florence and Genoa,
and then on along the Riviera to Marseilles.</p>
<p>In that brawling and turbulent French port,
after the usual rounds and the usual inquiries
down in the midst of the harbor-front forestry
of masts, he found a boatman who claimed to
have knowledge of Binhart&rsquo;s whereabouts.
This piratical-looking boatman promptly took
Blake several miles down the coast, parleyed in
the <i>lingua Franca</i> of the Mediterranean, argued
in broken English, and insisted on going
further. Blake, scenting imposture, demanded
to be put ashore. This the boatman
refused to do. It was then and only then that
the detective suspected he was the victim of a
&ldquo;plant,&rdquo; of a carefully planned shanghaing
movement, the object of which, apparently,
was to gain time for the fugitive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>It was only at the point of a revolver that
Blake brought the boat ashore, and there he
was promptly arrested and accused of attempted
murder. He found it expedient to
call in the aid of the American Consul, who, in
turn, suggested the retaining of a local advocate.
Everything, it is true, was at last made
clear and in the end Blake was honorably released.</p>
<p>But Binhart, in the meantime, had caught a
Lloyd Brazileiro steamer for Rio de Janeiro,
and was once more on the high seas.</p>
<p>Blake, when he learned of this, sat staring
about him, like a man facing news which he
could not assimilate. He shut himself up in his
hotel room, for an hour, communing with his
own dark soul. He emerged from that self-communion
freshly shaved and smoking a
cigar. He found that he could catch a steamer
for Barcelona, and from that port take a Campania
Transatlantic boat for Kingston, Jamaica.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>From the American consulate he carried
away with him a bundle of New York newspapers.
When out on the Atlantic he arranged
these according to date and went over
them diligently, page by page. They seemed
like echoes out of another life. He read listlessly
on, going over the belated news from his
old-time home with the melancholy indifference
of the alien, with the poignant impersonality
of the exile. He read of fires and crimes and
calamities, of investigations and elections. He
read of a rumored Police Department shake
up, and he could afford to smile at the vitality
of that hellbender-like report. Then, as he
turned the worn pages, the smile died from his
heavy lips, for his own name leaped up like a
snake from the text and seemed to strike him
in the face. He spelled through the paragraphs
carefully, word by word, as though it
were in a language with which he was only
half familiar. He even went back and read
the entire column for a second time. For there
it told of his removal from the Police Department.
The Commissioner and Copeland had
saved their necks, but Blake was no longer
Second Deputy. They spoke of him as being
somewhere in the Philippines, on the trail of the
bank-robber Binhart. They went on to describe
him as a sleuth of the older school, as an
advocate of the now obsolete &ldquo;third-degree&rdquo;
methods, and as a product of the &ldquo;machine&rdquo;
which had so long and so flagrantly placed politics
before efficiency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Blake put down the papers, lighted a cigar,
sat back, and let the truth of what he had read
percolate into his actual consciousness. He
was startled, at first, that no great outburst of
rage swept through him. All he felt, in fact,
was a slow and dull resentment, a resentment
which he could not articulate. Yet dull as it
was, hour by hour and day by idle day it grew
more virulent. About him stood nothing
against which this resentment could be marshaled.
His pride lay as helpless as a whale
washed ashore, too massive to turn and face the
tides of treachery that had wrecked it. All he
asked for was time. Let them wait, he kept
telling himself; let them wait until he got back
with Binhart! Then they would all eat crow,
every last man of them!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>For Blake did not intend to give up the trail.
To do so would have been beyond him. His
mental fangs were already fixed in Binhart.
To withdraw them was not in his power. He
could no more surrender his quarry than the
python&rsquo;s head, having once closed on the rabbit,
could release its meal. With Blake, every instinct
sloped inward, just as every python-fang
sloped backward. The actual reason for the
chase was no longer clear to his own vision.
It was something no longer to be reckoned
with. The only thing that counted was the
fact that he had decided to &ldquo;get&rdquo; Binhart, that
he was the pursuer and Binhart was the fugitive.
It had long since resolved itself into a
personal issue between him and his enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<h2 id="c12">XII</h2>
<p>Three hours after he had disembarked
from his steamer at Rio, Blake was
breakfasting at the Caf&eacute; Britto in the Ovidor.
At the same table with him sat a lean-jawed
and rat-eyed little gambler by the name of
Passos.</p>
<p>Two hours after this breakfast Passos
might have been seen on the Avenida Central,
in deep talk with a peddler of artificial diamonds.
Still later in the day he held converse
with a fellow gambler at the Paineiras, half-way
up Mount Corcovado; and the same
afternoon he was interrogating a certain discredited
concession-hunter on the Petropolis
boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>By evening he was able to return to Blake
with the information that Binhart had duly
landed at Rio, had hidden for three days in
the outskirts of the city, and had gone aboard
a German cargo-boat bound for Colon. Two
days later Blake himself was aboard a British
freighter northward bound for Kingston.
Once again he beheld a tropical sun shimmer
on hot brass-work and pitch boil up between
bone-white deck-boards sluiced and resluiced
by a half-naked crew. Once again he had to
face an enervating equatorial heat that vitiated
both mind and body. But he neither
fretted nor complained. Some fixed inner
purpose seemed to sustain him through every
discomfort. Deep in that soul, merely
filmed with its fixed equatorial calm, burned
some dormant and crusader-like propulsion.
And an existence so centered on one great issue
found scant time to worry over the trivialities
of the moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>After a three-day wait at Jamaica Blake
caught an Atlas liner for Colon. And at
Colon he found himself once more among his
own kind. Scattered up and down the
Isthmus he found an occasional Northerner
to whom he was not unknown, engineers and
construction men who could talk of things
that were comprehensible to him, gamblers
and adventurers who took him poignantly
back to the life he had left so far behind him.
Along that crowded and shifting half-way
house for the tropic-loving American he
found more than one passing friend to whom
he talked hungrily and put many wistful
questions. Sometimes it was a rock contractor
tanned the color of a Mexican saddle.
Sometimes it was a new arrival in Stetson and
riding-breeches and unstained leather leggings.
Sometimes it was a coatless dump-boss
blaspheming his toiling army of spick-a-dees.</p>
<p>Sometimes he talked with graders and car-men
and track-layers in Chinese saloons along
Bottle Alley. Sometimes it was with a
bridge-builder or a lottery capper in the bar-room
of the Hotel Central, where he would
sit without coat or vest, calmly giving an eye
to his game of &ldquo;draw&rdquo; or stolidly &ldquo;rolling
the bones&rdquo; as he talked&mdash;but always with his
ears open for one particular thing, and that
thing had to do with the movements or the
whereabouts of Connie Binhart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>One night, as he sat placidly playing his
game of &ldquo;cut-throat&rdquo; in his shirt-sleeves, he
looked up and saw a russet-faced figure as
stolid as his own. This figure, he perceived,
was discreetly studying him as he sat under
the glare of the light. Blake went on with
his game. In a quarter of an hour, however,
he got up from the table and bought a fresh
supply of &ldquo;green&rdquo; Havana cigars. Then he
sauntered out to where the russet-faced
stranger stood watching the street crowds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pip, what&rsquo;re you doing down in these
parts?&rdquo; he casually inquired. He had recognized
the man as Pip Tankred, with whom he
had come in contact five long years before.
Pip, on that occasion, was engaged in loading
an East River banana-boat with an odd ton
or two of cartridges designed for Castro&rsquo;s
opponents in Venezuela.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m freightin&rsquo; bridge equipment
down the West Coast,&rdquo; he solemnly announced.
&ldquo;And transshippin&rsquo; a few cases o&rsquo;
phonograph-records as a side-line!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a smoke?&rdquo; asked Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; responded the russet-faced bucaneer.
And as they stood smoking together
Blake tenderly and cautiously put out the
usual feelers, plying the familiar questions
and meeting with the too-familiar lack of response.
Like all the rest of them, he soon
saw, Pip Tankred knew nothing of Binhart
or his whereabouts. And with that discovery
his interest in Pip Tankred ceased.</p>
<p>So the next day Blake moved inland, working
his interrogative way along the Big Ditch
to Panama. He even slipped back over the
line to San Cristobel and Ancon, found nothing
of moment awaiting him there, and
drifted back into Panamanian territory. It
was not until the end of the week that the
first glimmer of hope came to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>It came in the form of an incredibly thin
<i>gringo</i> in an incredibly soiled suit of duck.
Blake had been sitting on the wide veranda
of the Hotel Angelini, sipping his &ldquo;swizzle&rdquo;
and studiously watching the Saturday evening
crowds that passed back and forth through
Panama&rsquo;s bustling railway station. He had
watched the long line of rickety cabs backed
up against the curb, the two honking autobusses,
the shifting army of pleasure-seekers
along the sidewalks, the noisy saloons round
which the crowds eddied like bees about a
hive, and he was once more appraising the
groups closer about him, when through that
seething and bustling mass of humanity he
saw Dusty McGlade pushing his way, a Dusty
McGlade on whom the rum of Jamaica and
the <i>mezcal</i> of Guatemala and the <i>anisado</i> of
Ecuador had combined with the <i>pulque</i> of
Mexico to set their unmistakable seal.</p>
<p>But three minutes later the two men were
seated together above their &ldquo;swizzles&rdquo; and
Blake was exploring Dusty&rsquo;s faded memories
as busily as a leather-dip might explore an inebriate&rsquo;s
pockets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you looking for, Jim?&rdquo; suddenly
and peevishly demanded the man in the soiled
white duck, as though impatient of the other&rsquo;s
indirections.</p>
<p>Blake smoked for a moment or two before
answering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a man called Connie Binhart,&rdquo;
he finally confessed, as he continued to
study that ruinous figure in front of him. It
startled him to see what idleness and alcohol
and the heat of the tropics could do to a man
once as astute as Dusty McGlade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo; complained
McGlade, as though impatient of obliquities
that had been altogether too apparent. He
had once been afraid of this man called Blake,
he remembered. But time had changed
things, as time has the habit of doing. And
most of all, time had changed Blake himself,
had left the old-time Headquarters man
oddly heavy of movement and strangely slow
of thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m saying it now!&rdquo; Blake&rsquo;s guttural
voice was reminding him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you say it an hour ago?&rdquo;
contested McGlade, with his alcoholic peevish
obstinacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have it now,&rdquo; placated the
patient-eyed Blake. He waited, with a show
of indifference. He even overlooked Dusty&rsquo;s
curt laugh of contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you all right, all right&mdash;but it
won&rsquo;t do you much good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; And still Blake was bland
and patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; retorted McGlade, fixing the
other man with a lean finger that was both
unclean and unsteady, &ldquo;<i>you can&rsquo;t get at him</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me where he is,&rdquo; said Blake,
striking a match. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to the rest of
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>McGlade slowly and deliberately drank the
last of his swizzle. Then he put down his
empty glass and stared pensively and pregnantly
into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there in it for me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Blake, studying him across the small table,
weighed both the man and the situation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred dollars in American greenbacks,&rdquo;
he announced as he drew out his wallet.
He could see McGlade moisten his flaccid
lips. He could see the faded eyes fasten
on the bills as they were counted out. He
knew where the money would go, how little
good it would do. But that, he knew, was
not <i>his</i> funeral. All he wanted was Binhart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Binhart&rsquo;s in Guayaquil,&rdquo; McGlade suddenly
announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo; you know that?&rdquo; promptly demanded
Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the man who sneaked him out from
Balboa. He got sixty dollars for it. I can
take you to him. Binhart&rsquo;d picked up a
medicine-chest and a bag of instruments from
a broken-down doctor at Colon. He went
aboard a Pacific liner as a doctor himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What liner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went aboard the <i>Trunella</i>. He
thought he&rsquo;d get down to Callao. But they
tied the <i>Trunella</i> up at Guayaquil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say he&rsquo;s there now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And aboard the <i>Trunella</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! He&rsquo;s got to be aboard the <i>Trunella</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why d&rsquo; you say I can&rsquo;t get at him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Guayaquil and the <i>Trunella</i> and
the whole coast down there is tied up in quarantine.
That whole harbor&rsquo;s rotten with
yellow-jack. It&rsquo;s tied up as tight as a drum.
You couldn&rsquo;t get a boat on all the Pacific to
touch that port these days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s got to be <i>something</i> going
there!&rdquo; contended Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They daren&rsquo;t do it! They couldn&rsquo;t get
clearance&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t even get <i>pratique</i>!
Once they got in there they&rsquo;d be held and
given the blood-test and picketed with a gunboat
for a month! And what&rsquo;s more,
they&rsquo;ve got that Alfaro revolution on down
there! They&rsquo;ve got boat-patrols up and
down the coast, keeping a lookout for gun-runners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake, at this last word, raised his ponderous
head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The boat-patrols wouldn&rsquo;t phase me,&rdquo; he
announced. His thoughts, in fact, were already
far ahead, marshaling themselves about
other things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a weakness for yellow fever?&rdquo; inquired
the ironic McGlade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;d take more than a few fever
germs to throw me off that trail,&rdquo; was the detective&rsquo;s
abstracted retort. He was recalling
certain things that the russet-faced Pip Tankred
had told him. And before everything
else he felt that it would be well to get in
touch with that distributor of bridge equipment
and phonograph records.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re going to try to
get into Guayaquil?&rdquo; demanded McGlade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Connie Binhart&rsquo;s down there I&rsquo;ve got
to go and get him,&rdquo; was Never-Fail Blake&rsquo;s
answer.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The following morning Blake, having made
sure of his ground, began one of his old-time
&ldquo;investigations&rdquo; of that unsuspecting worthy
known as Pip Tankred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>This investigation involved a hurried journey
back to Colon, the expenditure of much
money in cable tolls, the examination of records
that were both official and unofficial, the
asking of many questions and the turning up
of dimly remembered things on which the
dust of time had long since settled.</p>
<p>It was followed by a return to Panama, a
secret trip several miles up the coast to look
over a freighter placidly anchored there, a
dolorous-appearing coast-tramp with unpainted
upperworks and a rusty red hull.
The side-plates of this red hull, Blake observed,
were as pitted and scarred as the face
of an Egyptian obelisk. Her ventilators
were askew and her funnel was scrofulous and
many of her rivet-heads seemed to be eaten
away. But this was not once a source of apprehension
to the studious-eyed detective.</p>
<p>The following evening he encountered
Tankred himself, as though by accident, on
the veranda of the Hotel Angelini. The latter,
at Blake&rsquo;s invitation, sat down for a cocktail
and a quiet smoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>They sat in silence for some time, watching
the rain that deluged the city, the warm devitalizing
rain that unedged even the fieriest
of Signor Angelinas stimulants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pip,&rdquo; Blake very quietly announced,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re going to sail for Guayaquil to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; queried the unmoved Pip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to start for Guayaquil to-morrow,&rdquo;
repeated Blake, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re going
to take me along with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; retorted Pip, emitting a curling
geyser of smoke as long and thin as a
pool-que, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re sure laborin&rsquo; under the misapprehension
this steamer o&rsquo; mine is a Pacific
mailer! But she ain&rsquo;t, Blake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit that,&rdquo; quietly acknowledged the
other man. &ldquo;I saw her yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she don&rsquo;t carry no passengers&mdash;she
ain&rsquo;t allowed to,&rdquo; announced her master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s going to carry me,&rdquo; asserted
Blake, lighting a fresh cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What as?&rdquo; demanded Tankred. And he
fixed Blake with a belligerent eye as he put
the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an old friend of yours!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo; still challenged the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a man who knows your record, in the
next place. And on the next count, as the
man who&rsquo;s wise to those phony bills of lading
of yours, and those doped-up clearance
papers, and those cases of carbines you&rsquo;ve got
down your hold labeled bridge equipment,
and that nitro and giant-caps, and that hundred
thousand rounds of smokeless you&rsquo;re
running down there as phonograph records!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tankred continued to smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ever stop to wonder,&rdquo; he finally inquired,
&ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t kind o&rsquo; flirtin&rsquo; with danger
knowin&rsquo; so much about me and my freightin&rsquo;
business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re doing the coquetting in this
case, I guess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I ain&rsquo;t standin&rsquo; for no rivals&mdash;not
on this coast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men, so dissimilar in aspect and
yet so alike in their accidental attitudes of an
uncouth belligerency, sat staring at each
other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to take me to Guayaquil,&rdquo;
repeated Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re dead wrong,&rdquo; was
the calmly insolent rejoinder. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t even
<i>goin&rsquo;</i> to Guayaquil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tankred&rsquo;s smile translated his earlier deliberateness
into open contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to forget that this here town
you&rsquo;re beefin&rsquo; about lies a good thirty-five
miles up the Guayas River. And if I&rsquo;m gun-runnin&rsquo;
for Alfaro, as you say, I naturally
ain&rsquo;t navigatin&rsquo; streams where they&rsquo;d be able
to pick me off the bridge-deck with a fishin&rsquo;-pole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going to get as close to Guayaquil
as you can, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; said the man with the up-tilted
cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Pip,&rdquo; said Blake, leaning closer
over the table towards him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a
tinker&rsquo;s dam about Alfaro and his two-cent
revolution. I&rsquo;m not sitting up worrying
over him or his junta or how he gets his ammunition.
But I want to get into Guayaquil,
and this is the only way I can do it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>For the first time Tankred turned and
studied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo; you want to get into Guayaquil
for?&rdquo; he finally demanded. Blake knew that
nothing was to be gained by beating about the
bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man I want down there, and
I&rsquo;m going down to get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business,&rdquo; retorted Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And gettin&rsquo; into Guayaquil&rsquo;s your business!&rdquo;
Tankred snorted back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;m going to say is he&rsquo;s a man from
up North&mdash;and he&rsquo;s not in your line of business,
and never was and never will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have my word for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tankred swung round on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo; you realize you&rsquo;ll have to sneak ashore
in a <i>lancha</i> and pass a double line o&rsquo; patrol?
And then crawl into a town that&rsquo;s reekin&rsquo;
with yellow-jack, a town you&rsquo;re not likely to
crawl out of again inside o&rsquo; three months?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know all that!&rdquo; acknowledged Blake.</p>
<p>For the second time Tankred turned and
studied the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re still goin&rsquo; after your gen&rsquo;leman
friend from up North?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pip, I&rsquo;ve got to get that man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;o?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to, and I&rsquo;m going to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tankred threw his cigar-end away and
laughed leisurely and quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;re we sittin&rsquo; here arguin&rsquo;
about, anyway? If it&rsquo;s settled, it&rsquo;s settled,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it&rsquo;s settled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Tankred laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But take it from me, my friend, you&rsquo;ll
sure see some rough goin&rsquo; this next few
days!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<h2 id="c13">XIII</h2>
<p>As Tankred had intimated, Blake&rsquo;s journey
southward from Panama was anything
but comfortable traveling. The vessel
was verminous, the food was bad, and the heat
was oppressive. It was a heat that took the
life out of the saturated body, a thick and
burdening heat that hung like a heavy gray
blanket on a gray sea which no rainfall seemed
able to cool.</p>
<p>But Blake uttered no complaint. By day
he smoked under a sodden awning, rained on
by funnel cinders. By night he stood at the
rail. He stood there, by the hour together,
watching with wistful and haggard eyes the
Alpha of Argo and the slowly rising Southern
Cross. Whatever his thoughts, as he
watched those lonely Southern skies, he kept
them to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>It was the night after they had swung about
and were steaming up the Gulf of Guayaquil
under a clear sky that Tankred stepped down
to Blake&rsquo;s sultry little cabin and wakened him
from a sound sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you were gettin&rsquo; your clothes
on,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting my clothes on?&rdquo; queried Blake
through the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can&rsquo;t tell what we&rsquo;ll bump into,
any time now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wakened sleeper heard the other man
moving about in the velvety black gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing there?&rdquo; was his sharp
question as he heard the squeak and slam of
a shutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Closin&rsquo; this dead-light, of course,&rdquo; explained
Tankred. A moment later he
switched on the electric globe at the bunk-head.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; in pretty close now
and we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; with our lights doused!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>He stood for a moment, staring down at
the sweat-dewed white body on the bunk,
heaving for breath in the closeness of the little
cabin. His mind was still touched into
mystery by the spirit housed in that uncouth
and undulatory flesh. He was still piqued by
the vast sense of purpose which Blake carried
somewhere deep within his seemingly tepid-willed
carcass, like the calcinated pearl at the
center of an oyster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better turn out!&rdquo; he called back as
he stepped into the engulfing gloom of the
gangway.</p>
<p>Blake rolled out of his berth and dressed
without haste or excitement. Already, overhead,
he could hear the continuous tramping
of feet, with now and then a quiet-noted order
from Tankred himself. He could hear other
noises along the ship&rsquo;s side, as though a landing-ladder
were being bolted and lowered
along the rusty plates.</p>
<p>When he went up on deck he found the boat
in utter darkness. To that slowly moving
mass, for she was now drifting ahead under
quarter-speed, this obliteration of light imparted
a sense of stealthiness. This note of
suspense, of watchfulness, of illicit adventure,
was reflected in the very tones of the motley
deckhands who brushed past him in the humid
velvety blackness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>As he stood at the rail, staring ahead
through this blackness, Blake could see a light
here and there along the horizon. These
lights increased in number as the boat steamed
slowly on. Then, far away in the roadstead
ahead of them, he made out an entire cluster
of lights, like those of a liner at anchor.
Then he heard the tinkle of a bell below deck,
and he realized that the engines had stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>In the lull of the quieted ship&rsquo;s screw he
could hear the wash of distant surf, faint and
phantasmal above the material little near-by
boat-noises. Then came a call, faint and
muffled, like the complaining note of a harbor
gull. A moment later the slow creak of
oars crept up to Blake&rsquo;s straining ears. Then
out of the heart of the darkness that surrounded
him, not fifty feet away, he saw
emerge one faint point of light, rising and
falling with a rhythm as sleepy as the slow
creak of the oars. On each side of it other
small lights sprang up. They were close beside
the ship, by this time, a flotilla of lights,
and each light, Blake finally saw, came from
a lantern that stood deep in the bottom of a
boat, a lantern that had been covered with a
square of matting or sail-cloth, until some
prearranged signal from the drifting steamer
elicited its answering flicker of light. Then
they swarmed about the oily water, shifting
and swaying on their course like a cluster of
fireflies, alternately dark and luminous in the
dip and rise of the ground-swell. Within
each small aura of radiance the watcher at
the rail could see a dusky and quietly moving
figure, the faded blue of a denim garment, the
brown of bare arms, or the sinews of a straining
neck. Once he caught the whites of a
pair of eyes turned up towards the ship&rsquo;s deck.
He could also see the running and wavering
lines of fire as the oars puddled and backed in
the phosphorescent water under the gloomy
steel hull. Then he heard a low-toned argument
in Spanish. A moment later the flotilla
of small boats had fastened to the ship&rsquo;s side,
like a litter of suckling pigs to a sow&rsquo;s breast.
Every light went out again, every light except
a faint glow as a guide to the first boat at the
foot of the landing-ladder. Along this ladder
Blake could hear barefooted figures padding
and grunting as cases and bales were
cautiously carried down and passed from boat
to boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>He swung nervously about as he felt a hand
clutch his arm. He found Tankred speaking
quietly into his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be one boat over,&rdquo; that worthy
was explaining. &ldquo;One boat&mdash;you take that&mdash;the
last one! And you&rsquo;d better give the
<i>guinney</i> a ten-dollar bill for his trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! I&rsquo;m ready!&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s low-toned
reply as he started to move forward
with the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet! Not yet!&rdquo; was the other&rsquo;s irritable
warning, as Blake felt himself pushed
back. &ldquo;You stay where you are! We&rsquo;ve got
a half-hour&rsquo;s hard work ahead of us yet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>As Blake leaned over the rail again, watching
and listening, he began to realize that the
work was indeed hard, that there was some
excuse for Tankred&rsquo;s ill-temper. Most men,
he acknowledged, would feel the strain, where
one misstep or one small mistake might undo
the work of months. Beyond that, however,
Blake found little about which to concern
himself. Whether it was legal or illegal did
not enter his mind. That a few thousand tin-sworded
soldiers should go armed or unarmed
was to him a matter of indifference. It was
something not of his world. It did not impinge
on his own jealously guarded circle of
activity, on his own task of bringing a fugitive
to justice. And as his eyes strained
through the gloom at the cluster of lights far
ahead in the roadstead he told himself that it
was there that his true goal lay, for it was
there that the <i>Trunella</i> must ride at anchor
and Binhart must be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Then he looked wonderingly back at the
flotilla under the rail, for he realized that
every movement and murmur of life there had
come to a sudden stop. It was a cessation of
all sound, a silence as ominously complete as
that of a summer woodland when a hawk soars
overhead. Even the small light deep in the
bottom of the first <i>lancha</i> tied to the landing-ladder
had been suddenly quenched.</p>
<p>Blake, staring apprehensively out into the
gloom, caught the sound of a soft and feverish
throbbing. His disturbed mind had just
registered the conclusion that this sound must
be the throbbing of a passing marine-engine,
when the thought was annihilated by a second
and more startling occurrence.</p>
<p>Out across the blackness in front of him
suddenly flashed a white saber of light.
For one moment it circled and wavered restlessly
about, feeling like a great finger along
the gray surface of the water. Then it smote
full on Blake and the deck where he stood,
blinding him with its glare, picking out every
object and every listening figure as plainly as
a calcium picks out a scene on the stage.</p>
<p>Without conscious thought Blake dropped
lower behind the ship&rsquo;s rail. He sank still
lower, until he found himself down on his
hands and knees beside a rope coil. As he
did so he heard the call of a challenging Spanish
voice, a murmur of voices, and then a repeated
command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>There was no answer to this challenge.
Then came another command and then silence
again. Then a faint thrill arrowed through
Blake&rsquo;s crouching body, for from somewhere
close behind him a gun-shot rang out and was
repeated again and again. Blake knew, at
that sound, that Tankred or one of his men
was firing straight into the dial of the searchlight,
that Tankred himself intended to defy
what must surely be an Ecuadorean gunboat.
The detective was oppressed by the thought
that his own jealously nursed plan might at
any moment get a knock on the head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>At almost the same time the peevishly indignant
Blake could hear the tinkle of the
engine-room bell below him and then the
thrash of the screw wings. The boat began
to move forward, dangling the knocking and
rocking flotilla of <i>lanchas</i> and surf-boats at
her side, like a deer-mouse making off with its
young. Then came sharp cries of protest, in
Spanish, and more cries and curses in harbor-English,
and a second engine-room signal and
a cessation of the screw thrashings. This was
followed by a shower of carbine-shots and the
plaintive whine of bullets above the upperworks,
the crack and thud of lead against the
side-plates. At the same time Blake heard
the scream of a denim-clad figure that suddenly
pitched from the landing-ladder into
the sea. Then came an answering volley,
from somewhere close below Blake. He could
not tell whether it was from the boat-flotilla or
from the port-holes above it. But he knew
that Tankred and his men were returning the
gunboat&rsquo;s fire.</p>
<p>Blake, by this time, was once more thinking
lucidly. Some of the cases in those surf-boats,
he remembered, held giant-caps and
dynamite, and he knew what was likely to happen
if a bullet struck them. He also remembered
that he was still exposed to the carbine
fire from behind the searchlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>He stretched out, flat on the deck-boards,
and wormed his way slowly and ludicrously
aft. He did not bring those uncouth vermiculations
to a stop until he was well back in
the shelter of a rusty capstan, cut off from
the light by a lifeboat swinging on its davits.
As he clambered to his feet again he saw this
light suddenly go out and then reappear. As
it did so he could make out a patrol-boat, gray
and low-bodied, slinking forward through the
gloom. He could see that boat crowded with
men, men in uniform, and he could see that
each man carried a carbine. He could also
see that it would surely cut across the bow of
his own steamer. A moment later he knew
that Tankred himself had seen this, for high
above the crack and whine of the shooting and
the tumult of voices he could now hear Tankred&rsquo;s
blasphemous shouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cut loose those boats!&rdquo; bellowed the frantic
gun-runner. Then he repeated the command,
apparently in Spanish. And to this
came an answering babel of cries and expostulations
and counter-cries. But still the firing
from behind the searchlight kept up. Blake
could see a half-naked seaman with a carpenter&rsquo;s
ax skip monkey-like down the landing-ladder.
He saw the naked arm strike with
the ax, the two hands suddenly catch at the
bare throat, and the figure fall back in a huddle
against the red-stained wooden steps.</p>
<p>Blake also saw, to his growing unrest, that
the firing was increasing in volume, that at the
front of the ship sharp volley and counter-volley
was making a pandemonium of the
very deck on which he knelt. For by this
time the patrol-boat with the carbineers had
reached the steamer&rsquo;s side and a boarding-ladder
had been thrown across her quarter. And
Blake began to comprehend that he was in the
most undesirable of situations. He could
hear the repeated clang of the engine-room
telegraph and Tankred&rsquo;s frenzied and ineffectual
bellow of &ldquo;Full steam ahead! For
the love o&rsquo; Christ, full ahead down there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through all that bedlam Blake remained
resentfully cool, angrily clear-thoughted.
He saw that the steamer did not move forward.
He concluded the engine-room to be
deserted. And he saw both the futility and
the danger of remaining where he was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>He crawled back to where he remembered
the rope-coil lay, dragging the loose end of it
back after him, and then lowering it over the
ship&rsquo;s side until it touched the water. Then
he shifted this rope along the rail until it
swung over the last of the line of surf-boats
that bobbed and thudded against the side-plates
of the gently rolling steamer. About
him, all the while, he could hear the shouts of
men and the staccato crack of the rifles. But
he saw to it that his rope was well tied to the
rail-stanchion. Then he clambered over the
rail itself, and with a double twist of the rope
about his great leg let himself ponderously
down over the side.</p>
<p>He swayed there, for a moment, until the
roll of the ship brought him thumping against
the rusty plates again. At the same moment
the shifting surf-boat swung in under him.
Releasing his hold, he went tumbling down
between the cartridge-cases and the boat-thwarts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>This boat, he saw, was still securely tied to
its mate, one of the larger-bodied <i>lanchas</i>, and
he had nothing with which to sever the rope.
His first impulse was to reach for his revolver
and cut through the manilla strands by means
of a half-dozen quick shots. But this, he
knew, would too noisily announce his presence
there. So he fell on his knees and peered and
prodded about the boat bottom. There, to his
surprise, he saw the huddled body of a dead
man, face down. This body he turned over,
running an exploring hand along the belt-line.
As he had hoped, he found a heavy nine-inch
knife there.</p>
<p>He was dodging back to the bow of the
surf-boat when a uniformed figure carrying
a rifle came scuttling and shouting down the
landing-ladder. Blake&rsquo;s spirits sank as he
saw that figure. He knew now that his movement
had been seen and understood. He
knew, too, as he saw the figure come scrambling
out over the rocking boats, what capture
would mean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>He had the last strand of the rope severed
before the Ecuadorean with the carbine
reached the <i>lancha</i> next to him. He still felt,
once he was free, that he could use his revolver
and get away. But before Blake could
push off a sinewy brown hand reached out and
clutched the gunwale of the liberated boat.
Blake ignored the clutching hand. But, relying
on his own sheer strength, he startled the
owner of the hand by suddenly flinging himself
forward, seizing the carbine barrel, and
wresting it free. A second later it disappeared
beneath the surface of the water.</p>
<p>That impassioned brown hand, however,
still clung to the boat&rsquo;s gunwale. It clung
there determinedly, blindly&mdash;and Blake knew
there was no time for a struggle. He
brought the heavy-bladed knife down on the
clinging fingers. It was a stroke like that of
a cleaver on a butcher&rsquo;s block. In the strong
white light that still played on them he could
see the flash of teeth in the man&rsquo;s opened
mouth, the upturn of the staring eye-balls as
the severed fingers fell away and he screamed
aloud with pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>But with one quick motion of his gorilla-like
arms Blake pushed his boat free, telling
himself there was still time, warning himself
to keep cool and make the most of every
chance. Yet as he turned to take up the oars
he saw that he had been discovered by the
Ecuadoreans on the freighter&rsquo;s deck, that his
flight was not to be as simple as he had expected.
He saw the lean brown face, picked
out by the white light, as a carbineer swung
his short-barreled rifle out over the rail&mdash;and
the man in the surf-boat knew by that face
what was coming.</p>
<p>His first impulse was to reach into his
pocket for his revolver. But that, he knew,
was already too late, for a second man had
joined the first and a second rifle was already
swinging round on him. His next thought
was to dive over the boat&rsquo;s side. This
thought had scarcely formulated itself, however,
before he heard the bark of the rifle and
saw the puff of smoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>At the same moment he felt the rip and tug
of the bullet through the loose side-folds of
his coat. And with that rip and tug came a
third thought, over which he did not waver.
He threw up his hands, sharply, and flung
himself headlong across the body of the dead
man in the bottom of the surf-boat.</p>
<p>He fell heavily, with a blow that shook the
wind from his body. But as he lay there he
knew better than to move. He lay there,
scarcely daring to breathe, dreading that the
rise and fall of his breast would betray his
ruse, praying that his boat would veer about so
his body would be in the shadow. For he
knew the two waiting carbines were still
pointed at him.</p>
<p>He lay there, counting the seconds, knowing
that he and his slowly drifting surf-boat
were still in the full white fulgor of the wavering
searchlight. He lay there as a second
shot came whistling overhead, spitting into the
water within three feet of him. Then a third
bullet came, this time tearing through the
wood of the boat bottom beside him. And he
still waited, without moving, wondering what
the next shot would do. He still waited, his
passive body horripilating with a vast indignation
at the thought of the injustice of it all,
at the thought that he must lie there and let
half-baked dagoes shower his unprotesting
back with lead. But he lay there, still counting
the seconds, as the boat drifted slowly out
on the quietly moving tide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Then a new discovery disturbed him. It
obliterated his momentary joy at the thought
that they were no longer targeting down at
him. He could feel the water slowly rising
about his prostrate body. He realized that
the boat in which he lay was filling. He
calmly figured out that with the body of the
dead man and the cartridge-cases about him it
was carrying a dead weight of nearly half a
ton. And through the bullet hole in its bottom
the water was rushing in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Yet he could do nothing. He could make
no move. For at the slightest betrayal of
life, he knew, still another volley would come
from that ever-menacing steamer&rsquo;s deck. He
counted the minutes, painfully, methodically,
feeling the water rise higher and higher about
his body. The thought of this rising water
and what it meant did not fill him with panic.
He seemed more the prey of a deep and sullen
resentment that his plans should be so
gratuitously interfered with, that his approach
to the <i>Trunella</i> should be so foolishly
delayed, that so many cross-purposes should
postpone and imperil his quest of Binhart.</p>
<p>He knew, by the slowly diminishing sounds,
that he was drifting further and further away
from Tankred and his crowded fore-deck.
But he was still within the area of that ever-betraying
searchlight. Some time, he knew,
he must drift beyond it. But until that moment
came he dare make no move to keep himself
afloat.</p>
<p>By slowly turning his head an inch or two
he was able to measure the height of the gunwale
above the water. Then he made note of
where an oar lay, asking himself how long he
could keep afloat on a timber so small, wondering
how far he could be from land. Then
he suddenly fell to questioning if the waters
of that coast were shark infested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>He was still debating the problem when he
became conscious of a change about him. A
sudden pall of black fell like balm on his
startled face. The light was no longer there.
He found himself engulfed in a relieving,
fortifying darkness, a darkness that brought
him to his feet in the slowly moving boat. He
was no longer visible to the rest of the world.
At a breath, almost, he had passed into eclipse.</p>
<p>His first frantic move was to tug and drag
the floating body at his feet to the back of the
boat and roll it overboard. Then he waded
forward and one by one carefully lifted the
cases of ammunition and tumbled them over
the side. One only he saved, a smaller
wooden box which he feverishly pried open
with his knife and emptied into the sea.
Then he flung away the top boards, placing
the empty box on the seat in front of him.
Then he fell on his hands and knees, fingering
along the boat bottom until he found the
bullet-hole through which the water was boiling
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Once he had found it he began tearing at
his clothes like a madman, for the water was
now alarmingly high. These rags and shreds
of clothing he twisted together and forced
into the hole, tamping them firmly into place
with his revolver-barrel.</p>
<p>Then he caught up the empty wooden box
from the boat seat and began to bale. He
baled solemnly, as though his very soul were
in it. He was oblivious of the strange scene
silhouetted against the night behind him,
standing out as distinctly as though it were a
picture thrown on a sheet from a magic-lantern
slide&mdash;a circle of light surrounding a
drifting and rusty-sided ship on which tumult
had turned into sudden silence. He was oblivious
of his own wet clothing and his bruised
body and the dull ache in his leg wound of
many months ago. He was intent only on the
fact that he was lowering the water in his surf-boat,
that he was slowly drifting further and
further away from the enemies who had interfered
with his movements, and that under
the faint spangle of lights which he could still
see in the offing on his right lay an anchored
liner, and that somewhere on that liner lay a
man for whom he was looking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c14">XIV</h2>
<p>Once assured that his surf-boat would
keep afloat, Blake took the oars and began
to row. But even as he swung the boat
lumberingly about he realized that he could
make no headway with such a load, for almost
a foot of water still surged along its bottom.
So he put down the oars and began to bale
again. He did not stop until the boat was
emptied. Then he carefully replugged the
bullet-hole, took up the oars again, and once
more began to row.</p>
<p>He rowed, always keeping his bow towards
the far-off spangle of lights which showed
where the <i>Trunella</i> lay at anchor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>He rowed doggedly, determinedly. He
rowed until his arms were tired and his back
ached. But still he did not stop. It occurred
to him, suddenly, that there might be
a tide running against him, that with all his
labor he might be making no actual headway.
Disturbed by this thought, he fixed his attention
on two almost convergent lights on shore,
rowing with renewed energy as he watched
them. He had the satisfaction of seeing these
two lights slowly come together, and he knew
he was making some progress.</p>
<p>Still another thought came to him as he
rowed doggedly on. And that was the fear
that at any moment, now, the quick equatorial
morning might dawn. He had no means of
judging the time. To strike a light was impossible,
for his matches were water-soaked.
Even his watch, he found, had been stopped
by its bath in sea-water. But he felt that
long hours had passed since midnight, that it
must be close to the break of morning. And
the fear of being overtaken by daylight filled
him with a new and more frantic energy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>He rowed feverishly on, until the lights of
the <i>Trunella</i> stood high above him and he
could hear the lonely sound of her bells as the
watch was struck. Then he turned and
studied the dark hull of the steamer as she
loomed up closer in front of him. He could
see her only in outline, at first, picked out here
and there by a light. But there seemed something
disheartening, something intimidating,
in her very quietness, something suggestive of
a plague-ship deserted by crew and passengers
alike. That dark and silent hull at
which he stared seemed to house untold possibilities
of evil.</p>
<p>Yet Blake remembered that it also housed
Binhart. And with that thought in his mind
he no longer cared to hesitate. He rowed in
under the shadowy counter, bumping about
the rudder-post. Then he worked his way
forward, feeling quietly along her side-plates,
foot by foot.</p>
<p>He had more than half circled the ship before
he came to her landing-ladder. The
grilled platform at the bottom of this row of
steps stood nearly as high as his shoulders, as
though the ladder-end had been hauled up for
the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Blake balanced himself on the bow of his
surf-boat and tugged and strained until he
gained the ladder-bottom. He stood there,
recovering his breath, for a moment or two,
peering up towards the inhospitable silence
above him. But still he saw no sign of life.
No word or challenge was flung down at him.
Then, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, he lay flat
on the grill and deliberately pushed the surf-boat
off into the darkness. He wanted no
more of it. He knew, now, there could be
no going back.</p>
<p>He climbed cautiously up the slowly swaying
steps, standing for a puzzled moment at
the top and peering about him. Then he
crept along the deserted deck, where a month
of utter idleness, apparently, had left discipline
relaxed. He shied away from the
lights, here and there, that dazzled his eyes
after his long hours of darkness. With an
instinct not unlike that which drives the hiding
wharf-rat into the deepest corner at hand, he
made his way down through the body of the
ship. He shambled and skulked his way
down, a hatless and ragged and uncouth
figure, wandering on along gloomy gangways
and corridors until he found himself on the
threshold of the engine-room itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>He was about to back out of this entrance
and strike still deeper when he found himself
confronted by an engineer smoking a short
brier-root pipe. The pale blue eyes of this
sandy-headed engineer were wide with wonder,
startled and incredulous wonder, as they
stared at the ragged figure in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the name o&rsquo; God did <i>you</i> come
from?&rdquo; demanded the man with the brier-root
pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came out from Guayaquil,&rdquo; answered
Blake, reaching searchingly down in his wet
pocket. &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sandy-headed man backed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the fever camps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake could afford to smile at the movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;there&rsquo;s no fever &rsquo;round me.
<i>That&rsquo;s</i> what I&rsquo;ve been through!&rdquo; And he
showed the bullet-holes through his tattered
coat-cloth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rowed out in a surf-boat&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t go
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sandy-headed engineer continued to
stare at the uncouth figure in front of him, to
stare at it with vague and impersonal wonder.
And in facing that sandy-headed stranger,
Blake knew, he was facing a judge whose decision
was to be of vast moment in his future
destiny, whose word, perhaps, was to decide
on the success or failure of much wandering
about the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go back!&rdquo; repeated Blake, as he
reached out and dropped a clutter of gold
into the palm of the other man. The pale
blue eyes looked at the gold, looked out along
the gangway, and then looked back at the waiting
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Alfaro gang after you?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re <i>all</i> after me!&rdquo; answered the swaying
figure in rags. They were talking together,
by this time, almost in whispers, like
two conspirators. The young engineer seemed
puzzled. But a wave of relief swept through
Blake when in the pale blue eyes he saw almost
a look of pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo; you want me to do?&rdquo; he finally
asked.</p>
<p>Blake, instead of answering that question,
asked another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you move out of here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer put the coins in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before noon to-morrow, thank God! The
<i>Yorktown</i> ought to be here by morning&mdash;she&rsquo;s
to give us our release!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll sail by noon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to! They&rsquo;ve tied us up here
over a month, without reason. They worked
that old yellow-jack gag&mdash;and not a touch of
fever aboard all that time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great wave of contentment surged
through Blake&rsquo;s weary body. He put his hand
up on the smaller man&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you just get me out o&rsquo; sight until
we&rsquo;re off, and I&rsquo;ll fix things so you&rsquo;ll never
be sorry for it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>The pale-eyed engineer studied the problem.
Then he studied the figure in front of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing crooked behind this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake forced a laugh from his weary lungs.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove that in two days by wireless&mdash;and
pay first-class passage to the next port of
call!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fourth engineer on board here, and
the Old Man would sure fire me, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t even know about me,&rdquo;
contended Blake. &ldquo;Just let me crawl in somewhere
where I can sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need it, all right, by that face of
yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure do,&rdquo; acknowledged the other as he
stood awaiting his judge&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d better get you down to my bunk.
But remember, I can only stow you there until
we get under way&mdash;perhaps not that long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped cautiously out and looked along
the gangway. &ldquo;This is your funeral, mind,
when the row comes. You&rsquo;ve got to face
that, yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll face it, all right!&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s
calmly contented answer. &ldquo;All I want now
is about nine hours&rsquo; sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said the fourth engineer.
And Blake followed after as he started deeper
down into the body of the ship. And already,
deep below him, he could hear the stokers
at work in their hole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c15">XV</h2>
<p>After seven cataleptic hours of unbroken
sleep Blake awakened to find his
shoulder being prodded and shaken by the
pale-eyed fourth engineer. The stowaway&rsquo;s
tired body, during that sleep, had soaked in
renewed strength as a squeezed sponge soaks
up water. He could afford to blink with impassive
eyes up at the troubled face of the
young man wearing the oil-stained cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he demanded, awakening
to a luxurious comprehension of where he was
and what he had escaped. Then he sat up in
the narrow berth, for it began to dawn on him
that the engines of the <i>Trunella</i> were not in
motion. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t we under way?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re having trouble up there, with the
<i>Commandante</i>. We can&rsquo;t get off inside of an
hour&mdash;and anything&rsquo;s likely to happen in that
time. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve got to get you out of
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll you get me?&rdquo; asked Blake. He
was on his feet by this time, arraying himself
in his wet and ragged clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been talking over with
the Chief,&rdquo; began the young engineer. Blake
wheeled about and fixed him with his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you let your Chief in on this?&rdquo; he
demanded, and he found it hard to keep his
anger in check.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to let him in on it,&rdquo; complained the
other. &ldquo;If it came to a line up or a searching
party through here, they&rsquo;d spot you first
thing. You&rsquo;re not a passenger; you&rsquo;re not
signed; you&rsquo;re not anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, supposing I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;d haul you back and give you a
half year in that <i>Lazaretto</i> o&rsquo; theirs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do I have to do to keep from
being hauled back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be one o&rsquo; the workin&rsquo; crew,
until we get off. The Chief says that, and I
think he&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>A vague foreboding filled Blake&rsquo;s soul.
He had imagined that the ignominy and agony
of physical labor was a thing of the past with
him. And he was still sore in every sinew
and muscle of his huge body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean stoke-hole work?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>The fourth engineer continued to look worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to know anything about
machinery, do you?&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; retorted Blake, thinking
gratefully of his early days as a steamfitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why couldn&rsquo;t I put you in a cap
and jumper and work you in as one of the
greasers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by greasers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an oiler in the engine-room. It&mdash;it
may not be the coolest place on earth, in
this latitude, but it sure beats the stoke-hole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was in this way, thirty minutes later,
that Blake became a greaser in the engine-room
of the <i>Trunella</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Already, far above him, he could hear the
rattle and shriek of winch-engines and the far-off
muffled roar of the whistle, rumbling its
triumph of returning life. Already the
great propeller engines themselves had been
tested, after their weeks of idleness, languidly
stretching and moving like an awakening
sleeper, slowly swinging their solemn tons forward
through their projected cycles and then
as solemnly back again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>About this vast pyramid-shaped machinery,
galleried like a Latin house-court, tremulous
with the breath of life that sang and hissed
through its veins, the new greaser could see
his fellow workers with their dripping oil-cans,
groping gallery by gallery up towards
the square of daylight that sifted down into
the oil-scented pit where he stood. He could
see his pale-eyed friend, the fourth engineer,
spanner in hand, clinging to a moving network
of steel like a spider to its tremulous
web&mdash;and in his breast, for the first time, a
latent respect for that youth awakened. He
could see other greasers wriggling about between
intricate shafts and wheels, crawling
cat-like along narrow steel ledges, mounting
steep metal ladders guarded by hot hand rails,
peering into oil boxes, &ldquo;worrying&rdquo; the vacuum
pump, squatting and kneeling about iron
floors where oil-pits pooled and pump-valves
clacked and electric machines whirred and the
antiphonal song of the mounting steam roared
like music in the ears of the listening Blake,
aching as he was for the first relieving throb
of the screws. Stolidly and calmly the men
about him worked, threatened by flailing steel,
hissed at by venomously quiescent powers, beleaguered
by mysteriously moving shafts,
surrounded by countless valves and an inexplicable
tangle of pipes, hemmed in by an incomprehensible
labyrinth of copper wires, menaced
by the very shimmering joints and rods over
which they could run such carelessly affectionate
fingers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Blake could see the assistant engineers,
with their eyes on the pointers that stood out
against two white dials. He could see the
Chief, the Chief whom he would so soon have
to buy over and placate, moving about nervous
and alert. Then he heard the tinkle of the
telegraph bell, and the repeated gasp of energy
as the engineers threw the levers. He
could hear the vicious hum of the reversing-engines,
and then the great muffled cough of
power as the ponderous valve-gear was thrown
into position and the vaster machinery above
him was coerced into a motion that seemed
languid yet relentless.</p>
<p>He could see the slow rise and fall of the
great cranks. He could hear the renewed signals
and bells tinkles, the more insistent clack
of pumps, the more resolute rise and fall of the
ponderous cranks. And he knew that they
were at last under way. He gave no thought
to the heat of the oil-dripping pit in which
he stood. He was oblivious of the perilous
steel that whirred and throbbed about him.
He was unconscious of the hot hand rails and
the greasy foot-ways and the mingling odor
of steam and parching lubricant and ammonia-gas
from a leaking &ldquo;beef engine.&rdquo; He quite
forgot the fact that his <i>dungaree</i> jumper was
wet with sweat, that his cap was already fouled
with oil. All he knew was that he and Binhart
were at last under way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>He was filled with a new lightness of spirit
as he felt the throb of &ldquo;full speed ahead&rdquo;
shake the steel hull about which he so contentedly
climbed and crawled. He found
something fortifying in the thought that this
vast hull was swinging out to her appointed
sea lanes, that she was now intent on a way
from which no caprice could turn her. There
seemed something appeasingly ordered and
implacable in the mere revolutions of the engines.
And as those engines settled down to
their labors the intent-eyed men about him fell
almost as automatically into the routines of
toil as did the steel mechanism itself.</p>
<p>When at the end of the first four-houred
watch a gong sounded and the next crew filed
cluttering in from the half-lighted between-deck
gangways and came sliding down the
polished steel stair rails, Blake felt that his
greatest danger was over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>There would still be an occasional palm
to grease, he told himself, an occasional bit
of pad money to be paid out. But he could
meet those emergencies with the fortitude of
a man already inured to the exactions of venal
accomplices.</p>
<p>Then a new discovery came to him. It came
as he approached the chief engineer, with the
object in view of throwing a little light on his
presence there. And as he looked into that
officer&rsquo;s coldly indignant eye he awakened to
the fact that he was no longer on land, but
afloat on a tiny world with an autocracy and
an authority of its own. He was in a tiny
world, he saw, where his career and his traditions
were not to be reckoned with, where he
ranked no higher than conch-niggers and
beach-combers and <i>cargadores</i>. He was a
<i>dungaree</i>-clad greaser in an engine-room, and
he was promptly ordered back with the rest
of his crew. He was not even allowed to
talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>When his watch came round he went on
duty again. He saw the futility of revolt,
until the time was ripe. He went through his
appointed tasks with the solemn precision of
an apprentice. He did what he was commanded
to do. Yet sometimes the heat would
grow so intense that the great sweating body
would have to shamble to a ventilator and
there drink in long drafts of the cooler air.
The pressure of invisible hoops about the
great heaving chest would then release itself,
the haggard face would regain some touch of
color, and the new greaser would go back to
his work again. One or two of the more observant
toilers about him, experienced in engine-room
life, marveled at the newcomer and
the sense of mystery which hung over him.
One or two of them fell to wondering what
inner spirit could stay him through those four-houred
ordeals of heat and labor.</p>
<p>Yet they looked after him with even more
inquisitive eyes when, on the second day out,
he was peremptorily summoned to the Captain&rsquo;s
room. What took place in that room
no one in the ship ever actually knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>But the large-bodied stowaway returned
below-decks, white of face and grim of jaw.
He went back to his work in silence, in dogged
and unbroken silence which those about him
knew enough to respect.</p>
<p>It was whispered about, it is true, that
among other things a large and ugly-looking
revolver had been taken from his clothing, and
that he had been denied the use of the ship&rsquo;s
wireless service. A steward outside the Captain&rsquo;s
door, it was also whispered, had over-heard
the shipmaster&rsquo;s angry threat to put the
stowaway in irons for the rest of the voyage
and return him to the Ecuadorean authorities.
It was rumored, too, that late in the afternoon
of the same day, when the new greaser had
complained of faintness and was seeking a
breath of fresh air at the foot of a midships
deck-ladder, he had chanced to turn and look
up at a man standing on the promenade deck
above him.</p>
<p>The two men stood staring at each other for
several moments, and for all the balmy air
about him the great body of the stranger just
up from the engine-room had shivered and
shaken, as though with a malarial chill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>What it meant, no one quite knew. Nor
could anything be added to that rumor, beyond
the fact that the first-class passenger,
who was known to be a doctor and who had
stared so intently down at the quiet-eyed
greaser, had turned the color of ashes and
without a word had slipped away. And the
bewilderment of the entire situation was
further increased when the <i>Trunella</i> swung in
at Callao and the large-bodied man of mystery
was peremptorily and none too gently
put ashore. It was noted, however, that the
first-class passenger who had stared down at
him from the promenade-deck remained
aboard the vessel as she started southward
again. It was further remarked that he
seemed more at ease when Callao was left well
behind, although he sat smoking side by side
with the operator in the wireless room until
the <i>Trunella</i> had steamed many miles southward
on her long journey towards the Straits
of Magellan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<h2 id="c16">XVI</h2>
<p>Seven days after the <i>Trunella</i> swung
southward from Callao Never-Fail
Blake, renewed as to habiliments and replenished
as to pocket, embarked on a steamer
bound for Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>He watched the plunging bow as it crept
southward. He saw the heat and the gray
sea-shimmer left behind him. He saw the
days grow longer and the nights grow colder.
He saw the Straits passed and the northward
journey again begun. But he neither fretted
nor complained of his fate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>After communicating by wireless with both
Montevideo and Buenos Ayres and verifying
certain facts of which he seemed already assured,
he continued on his way to Rio. And
over Rio he once more cast and pursed up
his gently interrogative net, gathering in the
discomforting information that Binhart had
already relayed from that city to a Lloyd-Brazileiro
steamer. This steamer, he learned, was
bound for Ignitos, ten thousand dreary miles
up the Amazon.</p>
<p>Five days later Blake followed in a Clyde-built
freighter. When well up the river he
transferred to a rotten-timbered sidewheeler
that had once done duty on the Mississippi, and
still again relayed from river boat to river
boat, move by move falling more and more behind
his quarry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>The days merged into weeks, and the weeks
into months. He suffered much from the
heat, but more from the bad food and the bad
water. For the first time in his life he found
his body shaken with fever and was compelled
to use quinin in great quantities. The attacks
of insects, of insects that flew, that
crawled, that tunneled beneath the skin, turned
life into a torment. His huge triple-terraced
neck became raw with countless wounds. But
he did not stop by the way. His eyes became
oblivious of the tangled and overcrowded
life about him, of the hectic orchids and huge
butterflies and the flaming birds-of-paradise,
of the echoing aisle ways between interwoven
jungle growths, of the arching a&euml;rial roofs of
verdure and the shadowy hanging-gardens
from which by day parakeets chattered and
monkeys screamed and by night ghostly armies
of fireflies glowed. He was no longer impressed
by that world of fierce appetites and
fierce conflicts. He seemed to have attained
to a secret inner calm, to an obsessional impassivity
across which the passing calamities
of existence only echoed. He merely recalled
that he had been compelled to eat of disagreeable
things and face undesirable emergencies,
to drink of the severed water-vine, to partake
of monkey-steak and broiled parrot, to sleep
in poisonous swamplands. His spirit, even
with the mournful cry of night birds in his
ears, had been schooled into the acceptance
of a loneliness that to another might have
seemed eternal and unendurable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>By the time he had reached the Pacific coast
his haggard hound&rsquo;s eyes were more haggard
than ever. His skin hung loose on his great
body, as though a vampire bat had drained
it of its blood. But to his own appearance
he gave scant thought. For new life came
to him when he found definite traces of Binhart.
These traces he followed up, one by
one, until he found himself circling back eastward
along the valley of the Magdalena.
And down the Magdalena he went, still sure
of his quarry, following him to Bogota, and
on again from Bogota to Barranquilla, and
on to Savanilla, where he embarked on a Hamburg-American
steamer for Limon.</p>
<p>At Limon it was not hard to pick up
the lost trail. But Binhart&rsquo;s movements, after
leaving that port, became a puzzle to the man
who had begun to pride himself on growing
into knowledge of his adversary&rsquo;s inmost nature.
For once Blake found himself uncertain
as to the other&rsquo;s intentions. The fugitive
now seemed possessed with an idea to get away
from the sea, to strike inland at any cost, as
though water had grown a thing of horror to
him. He zigzagged from obscure village to
village, as though determined to keep away
from all main-traveled avenues of traffic.
Yet, move as he might, it was merely a matter
of time and care to follow up the steps of a
white man as distinctly individualized as Binhart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>This white man, it seemed, was at last giving
way to the terror that must have been
haunting him for months past. His movements
became feverish, erratic, irrational.
He traveled in strange directions and by
strange means, by bullock-cart, by burro, by
dug-out, sometimes on foot and sometimes on
horseback. Sometimes he stayed over night
at a rubber-gatherers&rsquo; camp, sometimes he visited
a banana plantation, bought a fresh
horse, and pushed on again. When he
reached the Province of Alajuela he made use
of the narrow cattle passes, pressing on in a
northwesterly direction along the valleys of
the San Juan and the San Carlos River. A
madness seemed to have seized him, a madness
to make his way northward, ever northward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Over heartbreaking mountainous paths,
through miasmic jungles, across sun-baked
plateaus, chilled by night and scorched by day,
chafed and sore, tortured by <i>niguas</i> and <i>coloradillas</i>,
mosquitoes and <i>chigoes</i>, sleeping in
verminous hay-thatched huts of bamboo bound
together with bejuco-vine, mislead by lying natives
and stolen from by peons, Blake day by
day and week by week fought his way after
his enemy. When worn to lightheadedness
he drank <i>guaro</i> and great quantities of black
coffee; when ill he ate quinin.</p>
<p>The mere act of pursuit had become automatic
with him. He no longer remembered
why he was seeking out this man. He no
longer remembered the crime that lay at the
root of that flight and pursuit. It was not
often, in fact, that his thoughts strayed back
to his old life. When he did think of it, it
seemed only something too far away to remember,
something phantasmal, something
belonging to another world. There were
times when all his journeying through steaming
swamplands and forests of teak and satinwood
and over indigo lagoons and mountain-passes
of moonlit desolation seemed utterly
and unfathomably foolish. But he fought
back such moods, as though they were a weakness.
He let nothing deter him. He stuck
to his trail, instinctively, doggedly, relentlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>It was at Chalavia that a peon named Tico
Viquez came to Blake with the news of a white
man lying ill of black-water fever in a native
hut. For so much gold, Tico Viquez intimated,
he would lead the se&ntilde;or to the hut in
question.</p>
<p>Blake, who had no gold to spare, covered
the startled peon with his revolver and commanded
Viquez to take him to that hut. There
was that in the white man&rsquo;s face which caused
the peon to remember that life was sweet. He
led the way through a reptilious swamp and
into the fringe of a nispero forest, where they
came upon a hut with a roof of corrugated
iron and walls of wattled bamboo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Blake, with his revolver in his hand and his
guide held before him as a human shield, cautiously
approached the door of this hut, for
he feared treachery. Then, with equal caution,
he peered through the narrow doorway.
He stood there for several moments, without
moving.</p>
<p>Then he slipped his revolver back into his
pocket and stepped into the hut. For there,
in one corner of it, lay Binhart. He lay on
a bed made of bull-hide stretched across a
rough-timbered frame. Yet what Blake
looked down on seemed more a shriveled
mummy of Binhart than the man himself. A
vague trouble took possession of the detective
as he blinked calmly down at the glazed and
sunken eyes, the gaunt neck, the childishly
helpless body. He stood there, waiting until
the man on the sagging bull-skin saw him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jim!&rdquo; said the sick man, in little
more than a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Connie!&rdquo; was the other&rsquo;s answer.
He picked up a palmetto frond and fought
away the flies. The uncleanness of the place
turned his stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Connie?&rdquo; he asked, sitting
calmly down beside the narrow bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>The sick man moved a hand, weakly, as
though it were the yellow flapper of some
wounded amphibian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jig&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; he said. The faint mockery
of a smile wavered across the painfully
gaunt face. It reminded the other man of
heat-lightning on a dark skyline. &ldquo;You got
me, Jim. But it won&rsquo;t do much good. I&rsquo;m
going to cash in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo; argued Blake,
studying the lean figure. There was a look
of mild regret on his own sodden and haggard
face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man on the bed did not answer for some
time. When he spoke, he spoke without looking
at the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said it was black-water fever. Then
they said it was yellow-jack. But I know
it&rsquo;s not. I think it&rsquo;s typhoid, or swamp
fever. It&rsquo;s worse than malaria. I dam&rsquo;
near burn up every night. I get out of my
head. I&rsquo;ve done that three nights. That&rsquo;s
why the niggers won&rsquo;t come near me now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Blake leaned forward and fought away the
flies again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a good thing I got up with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man rolled his eyes in their
sockets, so as to bring his enemy into his line
of vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not going to let you die,&rdquo; was
Blake&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help it, Jim! The jig&rsquo;s up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get a litter and get you up
out o&rsquo; this hell-hole of a swamp,&rdquo; announced
Blake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have you carried up
to the hills. Then I&rsquo;m going back to Chalavia
to get a doctor o&rsquo; some kind. Then I&rsquo;m going
to put you on your feet again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Binhart slowly moved his head from side to
side. Then the heat-lightning smile played
about the hollow face again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was some chase, Jim, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said,
without looking at his old-time enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Blake stared down at him with his haggard
hound&rsquo;s eyes; there was no answering smile on
his heavy lips, now furzed with their grizzled
growth of hair. There seemed something
ignominious in such an end, something futile
and self-frustrating. It was unjust. It left
everything so hideously incomplete. He revolted
against it with a sullen and senseless
rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, you&rsquo;re not going to die!&rdquo; declared
the staring and sinewy-necked man at
the bedside. &ldquo;I say you&rsquo;re not going to die.
I&rsquo;m going to get you out o&rsquo; here alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sweat of weakness stood out on Binhart&rsquo;s
white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; he asked, as he had asked once
before. And his eyes remained closed as he
put the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the pen,&rdquo; was the answer which rose to
Blake&rsquo;s lips. But he did not utter the words.
Instead, he rose impatiently to his feet. But
the man on the bed must have sensed that unspoken
response, for he opened his eyes and
stared long and mournfully at his heavy-bodied
enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get me there!&rdquo; he said, in little
more than a whisper. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<h2 id="c17">XVII</h2>
<p>Binhart was moved that night up into
the hills. There he was installed in a
bungalow of an abandoned banana plantation
and a doctor was brought to his bedside. He
was delirious by the time this doctor arrived,
and his ravings through the night were a
source of vague worry to his enemy. On the
second day the sick man showed signs of improvement.</p>
<p>For three weeks Blake watched over Binhart,
saw to his wants, journeyed to Chalavia
for his food and medicines. When the fever
was broken and Binhart began to gain
strength the detective no longer made the trip
to Chalavia in person. He preferred to remain
with the sick man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>He watched that sick man carefully, jealously,
hour by hour and day by day. A peon
servant was paid to keep up the vigil when
Blake slept, as sleep he must.</p>
<p>But the strain was beginning to tell on him.
He walked heavily. The asthmatic wheeze of
his breathing became more audible. His earlier
touch of malaria returned to him, and he
suffered from intermittent chills and fever.
The day came when Blake suggested it was
about time for them to move on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; asked Binhart. Little had
passed between the two men, but during all
those silent nights and days each had been secretly
yet assiduously studying the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to New York,&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s indifferent-noted
answer. Yet this indifference was
a pretense, for no soul had ever hungered more
for a white man&rsquo;s country than did the travel-worn
and fever-racked Blake. But he had his
part to play, and he did not intend to shirk
it. They went about their preparations
quietly, like two fellow excursionists making
ready for a journey with which they were already
over-familiar. It was while they sat
waiting for the guides and mules that Blake
addressed himself to the prisoner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Connie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking you back.
It doesn&rsquo;t make much difference whether I
take you back dead or alive. But I&rsquo;m going
to take you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man said nothing, but his slight
head-movement was one of comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I just wanted to say there&rsquo;s no side-stepping,
no four-flushing, at this end of the
trip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; was Binhart&rsquo;s listless response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you do,&rdquo; Blake went on in his dully
monotonous voice. &ldquo;Because I got where I
can&rsquo;t stand any more breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jim,&rdquo; answered Binhart. They
sat staring at each other. It was not hate that
existed between them. It was something more
dormant, more innate. It was something that
had grown ineradicable; as fixed as the relationship
between the hound and the hare.
Each wore an air of careless listlessness, yet
each watched the other, every move, every
moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>It was as they made their way slowly down
to the coast that Blake put an unexpected question
to Binhart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Connie, where in hell did you plant that
haul o&rsquo; yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This thing had been worrying Blake. Weeks
before he had gone through every nook and
corner, every pocket and crevice in Binhart&rsquo;s
belongings.</p>
<p>The bank thief laughed a little. He had
been growing stronger, day by day, and as his
spirits had risen Blake&rsquo;s had seemed to recede.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I left that up in the States, where it&rsquo;d
be safe,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you do about it?&rdquo; Blake casually
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell, just yet,&rdquo; was Binhart&rsquo;s retort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>He rode on silent and thoughtful for several
minutes. &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
both about done for. There&rsquo;s not much left
for either of us. We&rsquo;re going at this thing
wrong. There&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; money up there, for
somebody. And <i>you</i> ought to get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Blake. He
resented the bodily weakness that was making
burro-riding a torture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s worth a hundred and fifty
thousand dollars to you just to let me drop
out. I&rsquo;d hand you over that much to quit the
chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t me that&rsquo;s chasing you, Connie.
It&rsquo;s the Law!&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s quiet-toned response.
And the other man knew he believed
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you quit, and I&rsquo;ll stand for the
Law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, can&rsquo;t you see, they&rsquo;d never stand for
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes they would. I&rsquo;d just drop out,
and they&rsquo;d forget about me. And you&rsquo;d
have that pile to enjoy life with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake thought it over, ponderously, point
by point. For not one fraction of a second
could he countenance the thought of surrendering
Binhart. Yet he wanted both his prisoner
and his prisoner&rsquo;s haul; he wanted his
final accomplishment to be complete.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But how&rsquo;d we ever handle the deal?&rdquo;
prompted the tired-bodied man on the burro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember a woman called Elsie Verriner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; acknowledged Blake, with a pang of
regret which he could not fathom, at the mention
of the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we could fix it through her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Elsie Verriner know where that pile
is?&rdquo; the detective inquired. His withered
hulk of a body was warmed by a slow glow of
anticipation. There was a woman, he remembered,
whom he could count on swinging to his
own ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but she could get it,&rdquo; was Binhart&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what good would that do <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The two of us could go up to New Orleans.
We could slip in there without any one
being the wiser. She could meet us. She&rsquo;d
bring the stuff with her. Then, when you had
the pile in your hand, I could just fade off the
map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake rode on again in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how&rsquo;ll you prove it? How&rsquo;d I
know you&rsquo;d make good?&rdquo; demanded Binhart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not up to me! You&rsquo;re the man
that&rsquo;s got to make good!&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll give me the chance?&rdquo; half
pleaded his prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; replied Blake, as they rode on
again. He was wondering how many more
miles of hell he would have to ride through
before he could rest. He felt that he would
like to sleep for days, for weeks, without any
thought of where to-morrow would find him or
the next day would bring him.</p>
<p>It was late that day as they climbed up out
of a steaming valley into higher ground that
Binhart pulled up and studied Blake&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, you look like a sick man to me!&rdquo; he
declared. He said it without exultation; but
there was a new and less passive timber to his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been feeling kind o&rsquo; mean this last
day or two,&rdquo; confessed Blake. His own once
guttural voice was plaintive, as he spoke. It
was almost a quavering whine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better lay up for a few days?&rdquo;
suggested Binhart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay up nothing!&rdquo; cried Blake, and he
clenched that determination by an outburst of
blasphemous anger. But he secretly took
great doses of quinin and drank much native
liquor. He fought against a mental lassitude
which he could not comprehend. Never before
had that ample machinery of the body
failed him in an emergency. Never before had
he known an illness that a swallow or two of
brandy and a night&rsquo;s rest could not scatter to
the four winds. It bewildered him to find his
once capable frame rebelling against its tasks.
It left him dazed, as though he had been confronted
by the sudden and gratuitous treachery
of a life-long servant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>He grew more irritable, more fanciful. He
changed guides at the next native village, fearing
that Binhart might have grown too intimate
with the old ones. He was swayed by an
ever-increasing fear of intrigues. He coerced
his flagging will into a feverish watchfulness.
He became more arbitrary in his movements
and exactions. When the chance came, he
purchased a repeating Lee-Enfield rifle, which
he packed across his sweating back on the trail
and slept with under his arm at night. When
a morning came when he was too weak and
ill to get up, he lay back on his grass couch,
with his rifle across his knees, watching Binhart,
always watching Binhart.</p>
<p>He seemed to realize that his power was
slipping away, and he brooded on some plan
for holding his prisoner, on any plan, no matter
what it might cost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>He even pretended to sleep, to the end that
Binhart might make an effort to break away&mdash;and
be brought down with a bullet. He
prayed that Binhart would try to go, would
give him an excuse for the last move that
would leave the two of them lying there together.
Even to perish there side by side,
foolishly, uselessly, seemed more desirable than
the thought that Binhart might in the end get
away. He seemed satisfied that the two of
them should lie there, for all time, each holding
the other down, like two embattled stags with
their horns inextricably locked. And he
waited there, nursing his rifle, watching out of
sullenly feverish eyes, marking each movement
of the passive-faced Binhart.</p>
<p>But Binhart, knowing what he knew, was
content to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>He was content to wait until the fever grew,
and the poisons of the blood narcotized the
dulled brain into indifference, and then goaded
it into delirium. Then, calmly equipping himself
for his journey, he buried the repeating
rifle and slipped away in the night, carrying
with him Blake&rsquo;s quinin and revolver and
pocket-filter. He traveled hurriedly, bearing
southeast towards the San Juan. Four days
later he reached the coast, journeyed by boat
to Bluefields, and from that port passed on
into the outer world, where time and distance
swallowed him up, and no sign of his whereabouts
was left behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<h2 id="c18">XVIII</h2>
<p>It was six weeks later that a slender-bodied
young Nicaraguan known as Doctor Alfonso
Sedeno (his right to that title resulting
from four years of medical study in Paris)
escorted into Bluefields the flaccid and attenuated
shadow of Never-Fail Blake. Doctor
Sedeno explained to the English shipping
firm to whom he handed over his patient that
the Se&ntilde;or Americano had been found in a dying
condition, ten miles from the camp of the
rubber company for which he acted as surgeon.
The Se&ntilde;or Americano was apparently
a prospector who had been deserted by his
partner. He had been very ill. But a few
days of complete rest would restore him. The
sea voyage would also help. In the meantime,
if the shipping company would arrange
for credit from the hotel, the matter would
assuredly be put right, later on, when the necessary
despatches had been returned from New
York.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>For three weeks of torpor Blake sat in the
shadowy hotel, watching the torrential rains
that deluged the coast. Then, with the help
of a cane, he hobbled from point to point about
the town, quaveringly inquiring for any word
of his lost partner. He wandered listlessly
back and forth, mumbling out a description of
the man he sought, holding up strangers with
his tremulous-noted inquiries, peering with
weak and watery eyes into any quarter that
might house a fugitive. But no hint or word
of Binhart was to be gleaned from those wanderings,
and at the end of a week he boarded
a fruit steamer bound for Kingston.</p>
<p>His strength came back to him slowly during
that voyage, and when he landed at Kingston
he was able to walk without a stick. At
Kingston, too, his draft on New York was
finally honored. He was able to creep out to
Constant Spring, to buy new clothes, to ride
in a carriage when he chose, to eat a white
man&rsquo;s food again. The shrunken body under
the flaccid skin slowly took on some semblance
of its former ponderosity, the watery eyes
slowly lost their dead and vapid stare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>And with increase of strength came a corresponding
increase of mental activity. All day
long he kept turning things over in his tired
brain. Hour by silent hour he would ponder
the problem before him. It was more rumination
than active thought. Yet up from the
stagnating depths of his brooding would come
an occasional bubble of inspiration.</p>
<p>Binhart, he finally concluded, had gone
north. It was the natural thing to do. He
would go where his haul was hidden away.
Sick of unrest, he would seek peace. He
would fall a prey to man&rsquo;s consuming hunger
to speak with his own kind again. Convinced
that his enemy was not at his heels, he would
hide away somewhere in his own country.
And once reasonably assured that this enemy
had died as he had left him to die, Binhart
would surely remain in his own land, among
his own people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>Blake had no proof of this. He could not
explain why he accepted it as fact. He merely
wrote it down as one of his hunches. And
with his old-time faith in the result of that subliminal
reasoning, he counted what remained
of his money, paid his bills, and sailed from
Kingston northward as a steerage passenger
in a United Fruit steamer bound for Boston.</p>
<p>As he had expected, he landed at this
New England port without detection, without
recognition. Six hours later he stepped off a
train in New York.</p>
<p>He passed out into the streets of his native
city like a ghost emerging from its tomb.
There seemed something spectral in the very
chill of the thin northern sunlight, after the
opulent and oppressive heat of the tropics. A
gulf of years seemed to lie between him and
the actualities so close to him. A desolating
sense of loneliness kept driving him into the
city&rsquo;s noisier and more crowded drinking-places,
where, under the lash of alcohol, he was
able to wear down his hot ache of deprivation
into a dim and dreary regretfulness. Yet
the very faces about him still remained phantasmal.
The commonplaces of street life continued
to take on an alien aspect. They
seemed vague and far away, as though viewed
through a veil. He felt that the world had
gone on, and in going on had forgotten him.
Even the scraps of talk, the talk of his own
people, fell on his ear with a strange sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>He found nothing companionable in that
ca&ntilde;on of life and movement known as Broadway.
He stopped to stare with haggard and
wistful eyes at a theater front buoyed with
countless electric bulbs, remembering the
proud moment when he had been cheered in
a box there, for in his curtain-speech the
author of the melodrama of crime being presented
had confessed that the inspiration and
plot of his play had come from that great detective,
Never-Fail Blake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>He drifted on down past the caf&eacute;s and
restaurants where he had once dined and
supped so well, past the familiar haunts where
the appetite of the spirit for privilege had
once been as amply fed as the appetite of the
body for food. He sought out the darker
purlieus of the lower city, where he had once
walked as a king and dictated dead-lines and
distributed patronage. He drifted into the
underworld haunts where his name had at one
time been a terror. But now, he could see, his
approach no longer resulted in that discreet
scurry to cover, that feverish scuttling away
for safety, which marks the blacksnake&rsquo;s progress
through a gopher-village.</p>
<p>When he came to Centre Street, at the
corner of Broome, he stopped and blinked up
at the great gray building wherein he had once
held sway. He stood, stoop-shouldered and
silent, staring at the green lamps, the green
lamps of vigilance that burned as a sign to the
sleeping city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>He stood there for some time, unrecognized,
unnoticed, watching the platoons of broad-chested
&ldquo;flatties&rdquo; as they swung out and off
to their midnight patrols, marking the plainly
clad &ldquo;elbows&rdquo; as they passed quietly up and
down the great stone steps. He thought of
Copeland, and the Commissioner, and of his
own last hour at Headquarters. And then his
thoughts went on to Binhart, and the trail that
had been lost, and the task that stood still
ahead of him. And with that memory awakened
the old sullen fires, the old dogged and
implacable determination.</p>
<p>In the midst of those reviving fires a new
thought was fixed; the thought that Binhart&rsquo;s
career was in some way still involved with that
of Elsie Verriner. If any one knew of Binhart&rsquo;s
whereabouts, he remembered, it would
surely be this woman, this woman on whom,
he contended, he could still hold the iron hand
of incrimination. The first move would be to
find her. And then, at any cost, the truth
must be wrung from her.</p>
<p>Never-Fail Blake, from the obscure downtown
hotel, into which he crept like a sick
hound shunning the light, sent out his call for
Elsie Verriner. He sent his messages to
many and varied quarters, feeling sure that
some groping tentacle of inquiry would eventually
come in touch with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>Yet the days dragged by, and no answer
came back to him. He chafed anew at this
fresh evidence that his power was a thing of
the past, that his word was no longer law.
He burned with a sullen and self-consuming
anger, an anger that could be neither expressed
in action nor relieved in words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>Then, at the end of a week&rsquo;s time, a note
came from Elsie Verriner. It was dated and
postmarked &ldquo;Washington,&rdquo; and in it she
briefly explained that she had been engaged in
Departmental business, but that she expected
to be in New York on the following Monday.
Blake found himself unreasonably irritated
by a certain crisp assurance about this note, a
certain absence of timorousness, a certain unfamiliar
tone of independence. But he could
afford to wait, he told himself. His hour
would come, later on. And when that hour
came, he would take a crimp out of this calm-eyed
woman, or the heavens themselves would
fall! And finding further idleness unbearable,
he made his way to a drinking-place not
far from that juncture of First Street and
the Bowery, known as Suicide Corner. In
this new-world <i>Cabaret de Neant</i> he drowned
his impatience of soul in a Walpurgis Night
of five-cent beer and fusel-oil whiskey. But
his time would come, he repeated drunkenly,
as he watched with his haggard hound&rsquo;s eyes
the meretricious and tragic merriment of the
revelers about him&mdash;his time would come!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<h2 id="c19">XIX</h2>
<p>Blake did not look up as he heard the
door open and the woman step into the
room. There was an echo of his old-time
theatricalism in that dissimulation of stolid indifference.
But the old-time stage-setting,
he knew, was no longer there. Instead of sitting
behind an oak desk at Headquarters, he
was staring down at a beer-stained card-table
in the dingy back room of a dingy downtown
hotel.</p>
<p>He knew the woman had closed the door
and crossed the room to the other side of the
card-table, but still he did not look up at her.
The silence lengthened until it became acute,
epochal, climactic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You sent for me?&rdquo; his visitor finally said.
And as Elsie Verriner uttered the words he
was teased by a vague sense that the scene had
happened before, that somewhere before in
their lives it had been duplicated, word by
word and move by move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said with an effort at the
gruffness of assured authority. But the
young woman did not do as he commanded.
She remained still standing, and still staring
down at the face of the man in front of her.</p>
<p>So prolonged was this stare that Blake began
to be embarrassingly conscious of it, to
fidget under it. When he looked up he did
so circuitously, pretending to peer beyond the
white face and the staring eyes of the young
woman confronting him. Yet she ultimately
coerced his unsteady gaze, even against his
own will. And as he had expected, he saw
written on her face something akin to horror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>As he, in turn, stared back at her, and in her
eyes saw first incredulity, and then, what
stung him more, open pity itself, it came home
to him that he must indeed have altered for
the worse, that his face and figure must have
changed. For the first time it flashed over
him: he was only the wreck of the man he had
once been. Yet at the core of that wreck
burned the old passion for power, the ineradicable
appetite for authority. He resented
the fact that she should feel sorry for him.
He inwardly resolved to make her suffer for
that pity, to enlighten her as to what life was
still left in the battered old carcass which she
could so openly sorrow over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; he announced in his guttural
bass, as though to bridge a silence that
was becoming abysmal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; echoed Elsie Verriner.
She spoke absently, as though her mind were
preoccupied with a problem that seemed inexplicable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a little the worse for wear,&rdquo; he pursued,
with his mirthless croak of a laugh.
Then he flashed up at her a quick look of resentment,
a look which he found himself unable
to repress. &ldquo;While you&rsquo;re all dolled
up,&rdquo; he said with a snort, as though bent on
wounding her, &ldquo;dolled up like a lobster palace
floater!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>It hurt him more than ever to see that he
could not even dethrone that fixed look of pity
from her face, that even his abuse could not
thrust aside her composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a lobster palace floater,&rdquo; she
quietly replied. &ldquo;And you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a confidential agent of the Treasury
Department,&rdquo; was her quiet-toned answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; cried Blake. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve
grown so high and mighty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman sank into the chair beside which
she had been standing. She seemed impervious
to his mockery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want me for?&rdquo; she asked, and
the quick directness of her question implied
not so much that time was being wasted on side
issues as that he was cruelly and unnecessarily
demeaning himself in her eyes.</p>
<p>It was then that Blake swung about, as
though he, too, were anxious to sweep aside
the trivialities that stood between him and his
end, as though he, too, were conscious of the
ignominy of his own position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where I&rsquo;ve been and what I&rsquo;ve
been doing!&rdquo; he suddenly cried out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not positive that I do,&rdquo; was the
woman&rsquo;s guarded answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; thundered Blake. &ldquo;You
know as well as I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo; asked the
woman, almost indulgently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trailing Binhart, and you know
it! And what&rsquo;s more, you know where Binhart
is, now, at this moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it you wanted me for?&rdquo; reiterated
the white-faced woman, without looking
at him.</p>
<p>Her evasions did more than anger Blake;
they maddened him. For years now he had
been compelled to face her obliquities, to
puzzle over the enigma of her ultimate character,
and he was tired of it all. He made no
effort to hold his feelings in check. Even
into his voice crept that grossness which before
had seemed something of the body alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know where Binhart is!&rdquo; he
cried, leaning forward so that his head projected
pugnaciously from his shoulders like
the head of a fighting-cock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have only wasted time in sending
for me,&rdquo; was the woman&rsquo;s obdurate answer.
Yet beneath her obduracy was some
vague note of commiseration which he could
not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want that man, and I&rsquo;m going to get
him,&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s impassioned declaration.
&ldquo;And before you get out of this room you&rsquo;re
going to tell me where he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She met his eyes, studiously, deliberately, as
though it took a great effort to do so. Their
glances seemed to close in and lock together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; said the woman, and it startled him
to see that there were actual tears in her eyes.
But he was determined to remain superior to
any of her subterfuges. His old habit returned
to him, the old habit of &ldquo;pounding&rdquo; a
prisoner. He knew that one way to get at
the meat of a nut was to smash the nut. And
in all his universe there seemed only one issue
and one end, and that was to find his trail and
get his man. So he cut her short with his
quick volley of abuse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got your number, Elsie Verriner,
alias Chaddy Cravath,&rdquo; he thundered out,
bringing his great withered fist down on the
table top. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got every trick you ever
turned stowed away in cold storage. I&rsquo;ve
got &rsquo;em where they&rsquo;ll keep until the cows come
home. I don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;re a secret
agent or a Secretary of War. There&rsquo;s only
one thing that counts with me now. And
I&rsquo;m going to win out. I&rsquo;m going to win out,
in the end, no matter what it costs. If you
try to block me in this I&rsquo;ll put you where you
belong. I&rsquo;ll drag you down until you squeal
like a cornered rat. I&rsquo;ll put you so low
you&rsquo;ll never even stand up again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman leaned a little forward, staring
into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect this of you, Jim,&rdquo; she said.
Her voice was tremulous as she spoke, and still
again he could see on her face that odious and
unfathomable pity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of things weren&rsquo;t expected
of me. But I&rsquo;m going to surprise you all.
I&rsquo;m going to get what I&rsquo;m after or I&rsquo;m
going to put you where I ought to have put
you two years ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said the woman, white-lipped but
compelling herself to calmness, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go on
like this! Don&rsquo;t! You&rsquo;re only making it
worse, every minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making what worse?&rdquo; demanded Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole thing. It was a mistake, from
the first. I could have told you that. But
you did then what you&rsquo;re trying to do now.
And see what you&rsquo;ve lost by it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I lost by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost everything,&rdquo; she answered,
and her voice was thin with misery. &ldquo;Everything&mdash;just
as they counted on your doing,
just as they expected!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As who expected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Copeland and the others expected when
they sent you out on a blind trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sent out on a blind trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you found nothing when you went
out. Surely you remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>It seemed like going back to another world,
to another life, as he sat there coercing his
memory to meet the past, the abysmal and embittered
past which he had grown to hate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to say this Binhart case
was a frame up?&rdquo; he suddenly cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wanted you out of the way. It was
the only trick they could think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; declared Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a lie. They knew you&rsquo;d never
give up. They even handicapped you&mdash;started
you wrong, to be sure it would take
time, to be positive of a clear field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake stared at her, almost stupidly. His
mind was groping about, trying to find some
adequate motive for this new line of duplicity.
He kept warning himself that she was not to
be trusted. Human beings, all human beings,
he had found, moved only by indirection.
He was too old a bird to have sand thrown in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you welched on Binhart yourself.
You put me on his track. You sent me up to
Montreal!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They made me do that,&rdquo; confessed the unhappy
woman. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t in Montreal.
He never had been there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had a letter from him there, telling
you to come to 381 King Edward when the
coast was clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That letter was two years old. It was
sent from a room in the King Edward Hotel.
That was part of their plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat for a long time thinking it over,
point by point. He became disturbed by a
sense of instability in the things that had once
seemed most enduring, the sickening cataclysmic
horror of a man who finds the very earth
under his feet shaken by its earthquake. His
sodden face appeared to age even as he sat
there laboriously reliving the past, the past
that seemed suddenly empty and futile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you sold me out!&rdquo; he finally said,
studying her white face with his haggard
hound&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, Jim. You forced it on
me. You wouldn&rsquo;t give me the chance to do
anything else. I wanted to help you&mdash;but
you held me off. You put the other thing before
my friendship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do <i>you</i> know about friendship?&rdquo;
cried the gray-faced man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were friends once,&rdquo; answered the
woman, ignoring the bitter mockery in his cry.</p>
<p>He stared at her, untouched by the note of
pathos in her voice. There was something
abstracted about his stare, as though his mind
had not yet adjusted itself to a vast new discovery.
His inner vision seemed dazzled, just
as the eye itself may be dazzled by unexpected
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you sold me out!&rdquo; he said for a third
time. He did not move, but under that lava-like
shell of diffidence were volcanic and
coursing fires which even he himself could not
understand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, I would have done anything for you,
once,&rdquo; went on the unhappy woman facing
him. &ldquo;You could have saved me&mdash;from him,
from myself. But you let the chance slip
away. I couldn&rsquo;t go on. I saw where it
would end. So I had to save myself. I had
to save myself&mdash;in the only way I could. Oh,
Jim, if you&rsquo;d only been kinder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat with her head bowed, ashamed of
her tears, the tears which he could not understand.
He stared at her great crown of carefully
coiled and plaited hair, shining in the
light of the unshaded electric-bulb above them.
It took him back to other days when he had
looked at it with other eyes. And a comprehension
of all he had lost crept slowly home
to him. Poignant as was the thought that she
had seemed beautiful to him and he might
have once possessed her, this thought was obliterated
by the sudden memory that in her
lay centered everything that had caused his
failure. She had been the weak link in his
life, the life which he had so wanted to crown
with success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You welcher!&rdquo; he suddenly gasped, as he
continued to stare at her. His very contemplation
of her white face seemed to madden
him. In it he seemed to find some signal and
sign of his own dissolution, of his lost power,
of his outlived authority. In her seemed to
abide the reason for all that he had endured.
To have attained to a comprehension of her
own feelings was beyond him. Even the effort
to understand them would have been a
contradiction of his whole career. She only
angered him. And the hot anger that crept
through his body seemed to smoke out of some
inner recess of his being a hate that was as
unreasonable as it was animal-like. All the
instincts of existence, in that moment, reverted
to life&rsquo;s one primordial problem, the
problem of the fighting man to whom every
other man must be an opponent, the problem
of the feral being, as to whether it should kill
or be killed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>Into that unreasoning blind rage flared all
the frustration of months, of years, all the disappointments
of all his chase, all the defeat of
all his career. Even as she sat there in her
pink and white frailty she knew and nursed
the secret for which he had girdled the world.
He felt that he must tear it from her, that he
must crush it out of her body as the pit is
squeezed from a cherry. And the corroding
part of it was that he had been outwitted by
a woman, that he was being defied by a physical
weakling, a slender-limbed thing of ribbons
and laces whose back he could bend and
break across his great knee.</p>
<p>He lurched forward to his feet. His great
crouching body seemed drawn towards her by
some slow current which he could not control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Binhart?&rdquo; he suddenly gasped,
and the explosive tensity of that wheezing cry
caused her to look up, startled. He swayed
toward her as she did so, swept by some power
not his own. There was something leonine in
his movement, something leonine in his snarl
as he fell on her. He caught her body in his
great arms and shook it. He moved without
any sense of movement, without any memory
of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Binhart?&rdquo; he repeated, foolishly,
for by this time his great hand had closed on
her throat and all power of speech was beyond
her. He swung her about and bore her
back across the table. She did not struggle.
She lay there so passive in his clutch that a
dull pride came to him at the thought of his
own strength. This belated sense of power
seemed to intoxicate him. He was swept by
a blind passion to crush, to obliterate. It
seemed as though the rare and final moment
for the righting of vast wrongs, for the ending
of great injustices, were at hand. His
one surprise was that she did not resist him,
that she did not struggle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>From side to side he twisted and flailed her
body about, in his madness, gloating over her
final subserviency to his will, marveling how
well adapted for attack was this soft and slender
column of the neck, on which his throttling
fingers had fastened themselves. Instinctively
they had sought out and closed on that slender
column, guided to it by some ancestral propulsion,
by some heritage of the brute. It was
made to get a grip on, a neck like that! And
he grunted aloud, with wheezing and voluptuous
grunts of gratification, as he saw the white
face alter and the wide eyes darken with terror.
He was making her suffer. He was no
longer enveloped by that mild and tragically
inquiring stare that had so discomforted him.
He was no longer stung by the thought that
she was good to look on, even with her head
pinned down against a beer-stained card-table.
He was converting her into something useless
and broken, into something that could no
longer come between him and his ends. He
was completely and finally humiliating her.
He was breaking her. He was converting her
into something corrupt. . . . Then his pendulous
throat choked with a falsetto gasp of
wonder. <i>He was killing her!</i></p>
<p>Then, as suddenly as it had come, the smoke
of that mental explosion seemed to clear
away. Even as he gaped into the white face
so close to his own he awoke to reason. The
consciousness of how futile, of how odious, of
how maniacal, it all was swept over him. He
had fallen low, but he had never dreamed that
he could fall so low as this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>A reaction of physical nausea left him weak
and dizzy. The flexor muscles of his fingers
relaxed. An ague of weakness crept through
his limbs. A vertiginous faintness brought
him half tumbling and half rolling back into
his chair, wheezing and moist with sweat. He
sat there looking about him, like a sheep killer
looking up from the ewe it has captured.</p>
<p>Then his great chest heaved and shook with
hysterical sobbing. When, a little later, he
heard the shaken woman&rsquo;s antiphonal sobs,
the realization of how low he had fallen kept
him from looking at her. A great shame possessed
him. He stumbled out of the room.
He groped his way down to the open streets,
a haggard and broken man from whom life
had wrung some final hope of honor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<h2 id="c20">XX</h2>
<p>No catastrophe that was mental in its
origin could oppress for long a man so
essentially physical as Blake. For two desolate
hours, it is true, he wandered about the
streets of the city, struggling to medicine his
depression of the mind by sheer weariness of
the body. Then the habit of a lifetime of
activity reasserted itself. He felt the need
of focusing his resentment on something
tangible and material. And as a comparative
clarity of vision returned to him there also
came back those tendencies of the instinctive
fighter, the innate protest against injustice,
the revolt against final surrender, the forlorn
claim for at least a fighting chance. And
with the thought of his official downfall came
the thought of Copeland and what Copeland
had done to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>Out of that ferment of futile protest arose
one sudden decision. Even before he articulated
the decision he found it unconsciously
swaying his movements and directing his
steps. He would go and see Copeland! He
would find that bloodless little shrimp and put
him face to face with a few plain truths. He
would confront that anemic Deputy-Commissioner
and at least let him know what one
honest man thought of him.</p>
<p>Even when Blake stood before Copeland&rsquo;s
brownstone-fronted house, the house that
seemed to wear a mask of staid discretion in
every drawn blind and gloomy story, no hesitation
came to him. His naturally primitive
mind foresaw no difficulties in that possible
encounter. He knew it was late, that it was
nearly midnight, but even that did not deter
him. The recklessness of utter desperation
was on him. His purpose was something
that transcended the mere trivialities of every-day
intercourse. And he must see him. To
confront Copeland became essential to his
scheme of things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>He went ponderously up the brownstone
steps and rang the bell. He waited patiently
until his ring was answered. It was some
time before the door swung open. Inside
that door Blake saw a solemn-eyed servant in
a black spiked-tailed service-coat and gray
trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see Mr. Copeland,&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s
calmly assured announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Copeland is not at home,&rdquo; answered
the man in the service-coat. His tone was
politely impersonal. His face, too, was impassive.
But one quick glance seemed to have
appraised the man on the doorstep, to have
judged him, and in some way to have found
him undesirable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is important,&rdquo; said Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir,&rdquo; answered the impersonal-eyed
servant. Blake made an effort to keep
himself in perfect control. He knew that his
unkempt figure had not won the good-will of
that autocratic hireling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Police Headquarters,&rdquo; the man
on the doorstep explained, with the easy mendacity
that was a heritage of his older days.
He produced the one official card that remained
with him, the one worn and dog-eared
and once water-soaked Deputy-Commissioner&rsquo;s
card which still remained in his dog-eared
wallet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to see him on business,
Departmental business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Copeland are at the Metropolitan,
sir,&rdquo; explained the servant. &ldquo;At the
Opera. And they are not back yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll wait for him,&rdquo; announced Blake,
placated by the humbler note in the voice of
the man in the service-coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; announced the servant.
And he led the way upstairs, switching on the
electrics as he went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>Blake found himself in what seemed to be
a library. About this softly hung room he
peered with an acute yet heavy disdain, with
an indeterminate envy which he could not control.
It struck him as being feminine and
over fine, that shadowy room with all its warm
hangings and polished wood. It stood for a
phase of life with which he had no patience.
And he kept telling himself that it had not
been come by honestly, that on everything
about him, from the silver desk ornaments to
the marble bust glimmering out of its shadowy
background, he himself had some secret claim.
He scowled up at a number of signed etchings
and a row of diminutive and heavily
framed canvases, scowled up at them with
quick contempt. Then he peered uncomfortably
about at the shelves of books, mottled
streaks of vellum and morocco stippled with
gold, crowded pickets of soft-lettered color
which seemed to stand between him and a
world which he had never cared to enter. It
was a foolish world, that world of book reading,
a lackadaisical region of unreality, a place
for women and children, but never meant for
a man with a man&rsquo;s work to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>His stolidly contemptuous eyes were still
peering about the room when the door opened
and closed again. There was something so
characteristically guarded and secretive in the
movement that Blake knew it was Copeland
even before he let his gaze wheel around to
the newcomer. About the entire figure, in
fact, he could detect that familiar veiled wariness,
that enigmatic and self-concealing cautiousness
which had always had the power to
touch him into a quick irritation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake, I believe,&rdquo; said Copeland, very
quietly. He was in full evening dress. In
one hand he held a silk hat and over one arm
hung a black top-coat. He held himself in
perfect control, in too perfect control, yet his
thin face was almost ashen in color, almost the
neutral-tinted gray of a battle-ship&rsquo;s side-plates.
And when he spoke it was with the
impersonal polite unction with which he might
have addressed an utter stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wished to see me!&rdquo; he said, as his gaze
fastened itself on Blake&rsquo;s figure. The fact
that he remained standing imparted a tentativeness
to the situation. Yet his eyes remained
on Blake, studying him with the cold
and mildly abstracted curiosity with which he
might view a mummy in its case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; said Blake, without rising from his
chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; asked Copeland. There
was an acidulated crispness in his voice which
hinted that time might be a matter of importance
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what it&rsquo;s about, all right,&rdquo; was
Blake&rsquo;s heavy retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Copeland, putting
down his hat and coat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite in the dark
as to how I can be of service to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both his tone and his words angered Blake,
angered him unreasonably. But he kept
warning himself to wait, to hold himself in
until the proper moment arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect no service from you,&rdquo; was Blake&rsquo;s
curtly guttural response. He croaked out his
mirthless ghost of a laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taught
me better than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Copeland, for all his iciness, seemed to resent
the thrust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have always something to learn,&rdquo; he
retorted, meeting Blake&rsquo;s stolid stare of
enmity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve learned enough!&rdquo; said
Blake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I hope it has brought you what you
are looking for!&rdquo; Copeland, as he spoke,
stepped over to a chair, but he still remained
on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it hasn&rsquo;t brought me what I&rsquo;m after,&rdquo;
said the other man. &ldquo;Not yet! But it&rsquo;s
going to, in the end, Mr. Copeland, or I&rsquo;m
going to know the reason why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept warning himself to be calm, yet he
found his voice shaking a little as he spoke.
The time was not yet ripe for his outbreak.
The climactic moment was still some distance
away. But he could feel it emerging from the
mist just as a pilot sights the bell-buoy that
marks his changing channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then might I ask what you are after?&rdquo;
inquired Copeland. He folded his arms, as
though to fortify himself behind a pretense of
indifferency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;ve been after, just as I
know what you&rsquo;ve been after,&rdquo; cried Blake.
&ldquo;You set out to get my berth, and you got it.
And I set out to get Binhart, to get the man
your whole push couldn&rsquo;t round up&mdash;and I&rsquo;m
going to get him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blake,&rdquo; said Copeland, very quietly, &ldquo;you
are wrong in both instances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; was Copeland&rsquo;s answer, and he
spoke with a studious patience which his rival
resented even more than his open enmity.
&ldquo;In the first place, this Binhart case is a closed
issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with me!&rdquo; cried Blake, feeling himself
surrendering to the tide that had been tugging
at him so long. &ldquo;They may be able to buy off
you cuff-shooters down at Headquarters.
They may grease your palm down there, until
you see it pays to keep your hands off. They
may pull a rope or two and make you back
down. But nothing this side o&rsquo; the gates o&rsquo;
hell is going to make <i>me</i> back down. I began
this man-hunt, and <i>I&rsquo;m going to end it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took on a dignity in his own eyes. He
felt that in the face of every obstacle he was
still the instrument of an ineluctable and incorruptible
Justice. Uncouth and buffeted as
his withered figure may have been, it still represented
the relentlessness of the Law.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That man-hunt is out of our hands,&rdquo; he
heard Copeland saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not out of <i>my</i> hands!&rdquo; reiterated
the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s out of your hands, too,&rdquo; answered
Copeland. He spoke with a calm authority,
with a finality, that nettled the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you driving at?&rdquo; he cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Binhart hunt is ended,&rdquo; repeated
Copeland, and in the eyes looking down at him
Blake saw that same vague pity which had
rested in the gaze of Elsie Verriner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, it&rsquo;s not ended!&rdquo; Blake thundered
back at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> ended,&rdquo; quietly contended the other.
&ldquo;And precisely as you have put it&mdash;Ended
by God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; cried Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be aware of the fact,
Blake, that Binhart is dead&mdash;dead and
buried!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake stared up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is what?&rdquo; his lips automatically inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Binhart died seven weeks ago. He died
in the town of Toluca, out in Arizona. He&rsquo;s
buried there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; cried Blake, sagging forward
in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had the Ph&oelig;nix authorities verify the
report in every detail. There is no shadow of
doubt about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Blake stared up at the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; he wheezed.</p>
<p>Copeland did not answer him. He stepped
to the end of the desk and with his scholarly
white finger touched a mother-of-pearl bell
button. Utter silence reigned in the room until
the servant answered his summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bridley, go to my secretary and bring me
the portfolio in the second drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake heard and yet did not hear the message.
A fog-like sense of unreality seemed
to drape everything about him. The earth itself
seemed to crumble away and leave him
poised alone in the very emptiness of space.
Binhart was dead!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>He could hear Copeland&rsquo;s voice far away.
He could see the returning figure of the servant,
but it seemed as gray and ghostlike as
the entire room about him. In his shaking
fingers he took the official papers which Copeland
handed over to him. He could read the
words, he could see the signatures, but they
seemed unable to impart any clear-cut message
to his brain. His dazed eyes wandered over
the newspaper clippings which Copeland
thrust into his unsteady fingers. There, too,
was the same calamitous proclamation, as final
as though he had been reading it on a tombstone.
Binhart was dead! Here were the
proofs of it; here was an authentic copy of the
death certificate, the reports of the police verification;
here in his hands were the final and
indisputable proofs.</p>
<p>But he could not quite comprehend it. He
tried to tell himself it was only that his old-time
enemy was playing some new trick on
him, a trick which he could not quite fathom.
Then the totality of it all swept home to him,
swept through his entire startled being as a
tidal-wave sweeps over a coast-shoal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>Blake, in his day, had known desolation, but
it had seldom been desolation of spirit. It
had never been desolation like this. He tried
to plumb it, to its deepest meaning, but consciousness
seemed to have no line long enough.
He only knew that his world had ended. He
saw himself as the thing that life had at last
left him&mdash;a solitary and unsatisfied man, a
man without an aim, without a calling, without
companionship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this ends the music!&rdquo; he muttered, as
he rose weakly to his feet. And yet it was
more than the end of the music, he had to confess
to himself. It was the collapse of the
instruments, the snapping of the last string.
It was the ultimate end, the end that proclaimed
itself as final as the stabbing thought
of his own death itself.</p>
<p>He heard Copeland asking if he would care
for a glass of sherry. Whether he answered
that query or not he never knew. He only
knew that Binhart was dead, and that he himself
was groping his way out into the night, a
broken and desolate man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<h2 id="c21">XXI</h2>
<p>Several days dragged away before
Blake&rsquo;s mental clarity returned to him.
Then block by unstable block he seemed to
rebuild a new world about him, a new world
which was both narrow and empty. But it
at least gave him something on which to plant
his bewildered feet.</p>
<p>That slow return to the substantialities of
life was in the nature of a convalescence. It
came step by languid step; he knew no power
to hurry it. And as is so often the case with
convalescents, he found himself in a world
from which time seemed to have detached him.
Yet as he emerged from that earlier state of
coma, his old-time instincts and characteristics
began to assert themselves. Some deep-seated
inner spirit of dubiety began to grope
about and question and challenge. His innate
skepticism once more became active.
That tendency to cynical unbelief which his
profession had imposed upon him stubbornly
reasserted itself. His career had crowned
him with a surly suspiciousness. And about
the one thing that remained vital to that career,
or what was left of it, these wayward
suspicions arrayed themselves like wolves
about a wounded stag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>His unquiet soul felt the need of some final
and personal proof of Binhart&rsquo;s death. He
asked for more data than had been given him.
He wanted more information than the fact
that Binhart, on his flight north, had fallen ill
of pneumonia in New Orleans, had wandered
on to the dry air of Arizona with a &ldquo;spot&rdquo; on
his lungs, and had there succumbed to the
tubercular invasion for which his earlier sickness
had laid him open. Blake&rsquo;s slowly
awakening and ever-wary mind kept telling
him that after all there might be some possibility
of trickery, that a fugitive with the
devilish ingenuity of Binhart would resort to
any means to escape being further harassed by
the Law.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>Blake even recalled, a few days later, the
incident of the Shattuck jewel-robbery, during
the first weeks of his r&eacute;gime as a Deputy
Commissioner. This diamond-thief named
Shattuck had been arrested and released under
heavy bail. Seven months later Shattuck&rsquo;s
attorney had appeared before the District Attorney&rsquo;s
office with a duly executed certificate
of death, officially establishing the fact that
his client had died two weeks before in the city
of Baltimore. On this he had based a demand
for the dismissal of the case. He had succeeded
in having all action stopped and the
affair became, officially, a closed incident.
Yet two months later Shattuck had been seen
alive, and the following winter had engaged
in an Albany hotel robbery which had earned
for him, under an entirely different name, a
nine-year sentence in Sing Sing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>From the memory of that case Never-Fail
Blake wrung a thin and ghostly consolation.
The more he brooded over it the more morosely
disquieted he became. The thing grew
like a upas tree; it spread until it obsessed all
his waking hours and invaded even his dreams.
Then a time came when he could endure it no
more. He faced the necessity of purging his
soul of all uncertainty. The whimpering of
one of his unkenneled &ldquo;hunches&rdquo; merged into
what seemed an actual voice of inspiration to
him.</p>
<p>He gathered together what money he could;
he arranged what few matters still remained
to engage his attention, going about the task
with that valedictory solemnity with which the
forlornly decrepit execute their last will and
testament. Then, when everything was prepared,
he once more started out on the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Two weeks later a rough and heavy-bodied
man, garbed in the rough apparel of a mining
prospector, made his way into the sun-steeped
town of Toluca. There he went quietly to
the wooden-fronted hotel, hired a pack-mule
and a camp-outfit and made purchase, among
other things, of a pick and shovel. To certain
of the men he met he put inquiries as to
the best trail out to the Buenavista Copper
Camp. Then, as he waited for the camp-partner
who was to follow him into Toluca,
he drifted with amiable and ponderous restlessness
about the town, talking with the telegraph
operator and the barber, swapping
yarns at the livery-stable where his pack-mule
was lodged, handing out cigars in the wooden-fronted
hotel, casually interviewing the town
officials as to the health of the locality and the
death-rate of Toluca, acquainting himself with
the local undertaker and the lonely young
doctor, and even dropping in on the town officials
and making inquiries about main-street
building lots and the need of a new hotel.</p>
<p>To all this amiable and erratic garrulity
there seemed to be neither direction nor significance.
But in one thing the town of
Toluca agreed; the ponderous-bodied old newcomer
was a bit &ldquo;queer&rdquo; in his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>A time came, however, when the newcomer
announced that he could wait no longer for
his belated camp-partner. With his pack-mule
and a pick and shovel he set out, late one
afternoon, for the Buenavista Camp. Yet by
nightfall, for some strange reason, any one
traveling that lonely trail might have seen him
returning towards Toluca. He did not enter
the town, however, but skirted the outer fringe
of sparsely settled houses and guardedly made
his way to a close-fenced area, in which neither
light nor movement could be detected. This
silent place awakened in him no trace of either
fear or repugnance. With him he carried his
pick and shovel, and five minutes later the
sound of this pick and shovel might have been
heard at work as the ponderous-bodied man
sweated over his midnight labor. When he
had dug for what seemed an interminable
length of time, he tore away a layer of pine
boards and released a double row of screw-heads.
Then he crouched low down in the
rectangular cavern which he had fashioned
with his spade, struck a match, and peered
with a narrow-eyed and breathless intentness
at what faced him there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>One glance at that tragic mass of corruption
was enough for him. He replaced the screw-heads
and the pine boards. He took up his
shovel and began restoring the earth, stolidly
tramping it down, from time to time, with his
great weight.</p>
<p>When his task was completed he saw that
everything was orderly and as he had found
it. Then he returned to his tethered pack-mule
and once more headed for the Buenavista
Camp, carrying with him a discovery
which made the night air as intoxicating as
wine to his weary body.</p>
<p>Late that night a man might have been
heard singing to the stars, singing in the midst
of the wilderness, without rhyme or reason.
And in the midst of that wilderness he remained
for another long day and another long
night, as though solitude were necessary to
him, that he might adjust himself to some new
order of things, that he might digest some victory
which had been too much for his shattered
nerves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>On the third day, as he limped placidly back
into the town of Toluca, his soul was torn between
a great peace and a great hunger. He
hugged to his breast the fact that somewhere
in the world ahead of him a man once known
as Binhart still moved and lived. He kept
telling himself that somewhere about the face
of the globe that restless spirit whom he
sought still wandered.</p>
<p>Day by patient day, through the drought
and heat and alkali of an Arizona summer, he
sought some clue, some inkling, of the direction
which that wanderer had taken. But
about Binhart and his movements, Toluca and
Ph&oelig;nix and all Arizona itself seemed to know
nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing, Blake saw in the end, remained to
be discovered there. So in time the heavy-bodied
man with the haggard hound&rsquo;s eyes
took his leave, passing out into the world which
in turn swallowed him up as completely as it
had swallowed up his unknown enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<h2 id="c22">XXII</h2>
<p>Three of the busiest portions of New
York, varying with the various hours of
the day, may safely be said to lie in that
neighborhood where Nassau Street debouches
into Park Row, and also near that point where
Twenty-third Street intercepts Fourth Avenue,
and still again not far from where Broadway
and Fifth Avenue meet at the southwest
corner of Madison Square.</p>
<p>About these three points, at certain hours
of the day and on certain days of the week,
an observant stranger might have noticed the
strangely grotesque figure of an old cement
seller. So often had this old street-peddler
duly appeared at his stand, from month to
month, that the hurrying public seemed to
have become inured to the grotesqueness of his
appearance. Seldom, indeed, did a face turn
to inspect him as he blinked out at the lighted
street like a Pribiloff seal blinking into an
Arctic sun. Yet it was only by a second or
even a third glance that the more inquisitive
might have detected anything arresting in that
forlornly ruminative figure with the pendulous
and withered throat and cheek-flaps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>To the casual observer he was merely a picturesque
old street-peddler, standing like a
time-stained statue beside a carefully arrayed
exhibit of his wares. This exhibit, which invariably
proved more interesting than his own
person, consisted of a frame of gas-piping in
the form of an inverted U. From the top bar
of this iron frame swung two heavy pieces of
leather cemented together. Next to this coalesced
leather dangled a large Z made up of
three pieces of plate glass stuck together at
the ends, and amply demonstrating the adhesive
power of the cementing mixture to be
purchased there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>Next to the glass Z again were two rows
of chipped and serrated plates and saucers,
plates and saucers of all kinds and colors, with
holes drilled in their edges, and held together
like a suspended chain-gang by small brass
links. At some time in its career each one of
these cups and saucers had been broken across
or even shattered into fragments. Later, it
had been ingeniously and patiently glued together.
And there it and its valiant brothers
in misfortune swung together in a double row,
with a cobblestone dangling from the bottom
plate, reminding the passing world of remedial
beneficences it might too readily forget,
attesting to the fact that life&rsquo;s worst fractures
might in some way still be made whole.</p>
<p>Yet so impassively, so stolidly statuesque,
did this figure stand beside the gas-pipe that
to all intents he might have been cemented to
the pavement with his own glue. He seldom
moved, once his frame had been set up and his
wares laid out. When he did move it was
only to re-awaken the equally plethoric motion
of his slowly oscillating links of cemented
glass and chinaware. Sometimes, it is true,
he disposed of a phial of his cement, producing
his bottle and receiving payment with the absorbed
impassivity of an automaton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>Huge as his figure must once have been, it
now seemed, like his gibbeted plates, all battered
and chipped and over-written with the
marks of time. Like his plates, too, he carried
some valiant sense of being still intact,
still stubbornly united, still oblivious of every
old-time fracture, still bound up into personal
compactness by some power which defied the
blows of destiny.</p>
<p>In all seasons, winter and summer, apparently,
he wore a long and loose-fitting overcoat.
This overcoat must once have been
black, but it had faded to a green so conspicuous
that it made him seem like a bronze
figure touched with the mellowing <i>patina</i> of
time.</p>
<p>It was in the incredibly voluminous pockets
of this overcoat that the old peddler carried
his stock in trade, paper-wrapped bottles of
different sizes, and the nickels and dimes and
quarters of his daily trafficking. And as the
streams of life purled past him, like water past
a stone, he seemed to ask nothing of the world
on which he looked out with such deep-set and
impassive eyes. He seemed content with his
lot. He seemed to have achieved a Nirvana-like
indifferency towards all his kind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>Yet there were times, as he waited beside
his stand, as lethargic as a lobster in a fish-peddler&rsquo;s
window, when his flaccid, exploring
fingers dug deeper into one of those capacious
side-pockets and there came in contact with
two oddly shaped wristlets of polished steel.
At such times his intent eyes would film, as
the eyes of a caged eagle sometimes do.
Sometimes, too, he would smile with the half-pensive
Castilian smile of an uncouth and
corpulent Cervantes.</p>
<p>But as a rule his face was expressionless.
About the entire moss-green figure seemed
something faded and futile, like a street-lamp
left burning after sunrise. At other times, as
the patrolman on the beat sauntered by in his
authoritative blue stippled with its metal buttons,
the old peddler&rsquo;s watching eyes would
wander wistfully after the nonchalant figure.
At such times a meditative and melancholy intentness
would fix itself on the faded old face,
and the stooping old shoulders would even unconsciously
heave with a sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>As a rule, however, the great green-clad
figure with its fringe of white hair&mdash;the fringe
that stood blithely out from the faded hat
brim like the halo of some medieval saint on
a missal&mdash;did not permit his gaze to wander so
far afield.</p>
<p>For, idle as that figure seemed, the brain
behind it was forever active, forever vigilant
and alert. The deep-set eyes under their lids
that hung as loose as old parchment were always
fixed on the life that flowed past them.
No face, as those eyes opened and closed like
the gills of a dying fish, escaped their inspection.
Every man who came within their range
of vision was duly examined and adjudicated.
Every human atom of that forever ebbing
and flowing tide of life had to pass through
an invisible screen of inspection, had in some
intangible way to justify itself as it proceeded
on its unknown movement towards an unknown
end. And on the loose-skinned and
haggard face, had it been studied closely
enough, could have been seen a vague and
wistful note of expectancy, a guarded and
muffled sense of anticipation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>Yet to-day, as on all other days, nobody
stopped to study the old cement-seller&rsquo;s face.
The pink-cheeked young patrolman, swinging
back on his beat, tattooed with his ash night-stick
on the gas-pipe frame and peered indifferently
down at the battered and gibbeted
crockery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Batty,&rdquo; he said as he set the exhibit
oscillating with a push of the knee. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good,&rdquo; answered the patient and
guttural voice. But the eyes that seemed as
calm as a cow&rsquo;s eyes did not look at the patrolman
as he spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>He had nothing to fear. He knew that he
had his license. He knew that under the
faded green of his overcoat was an oval-shaped
street-peddler&rsquo;s badge. He also knew, which
the patrolman did not, that under the lapel
of his inner coat was a badge of another shape
and design, the badge which season by season
the indulgent new head of the Detective Bureau
extended to him with his further privilege
of a special officer&rsquo;s license. For this empty
honor &ldquo;Batty&rdquo; Blake&mdash;for as &ldquo;Batty&rdquo; he was
known to nearly all the cities of America&mdash;did
an occasional bit of &ldquo;stooling&rdquo; for the Central
Office, a tip as to a stray yeggman&rsquo;s return,
a hint as to a &ldquo;peterman&rsquo;s&rdquo; activities in
the shopping crowds, a whisper that a till tapper
had failed to respect the Department&rsquo;s
dead-lines.</p>
<p>Yet nobody took Batty Blake seriously. It
was said, indeed, that once, in the old r&eacute;gime,
he had been a big man in the Department.
But that Department had known many
changes, and where life is unduly active, memory
is apt to be unduly short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>The patrolman tapping on the gas-pipe arch
with his idle night-stick merely knew that
Batty was placid and inoffensive, that he never
obstructed traffic and always carried a license-badge.
He knew that in damp weather Batty
limped and confessed that his leg pained him
a bit, from an old hurt he&rsquo;d had in the East.
And he had heard somewhere that Batty was
a sort of Wandering Jew, patroling the whole
length of the continent with his broken plates
and his gas-pipe frame and his glue-bottles,
migrating restlessly from city to city, striking
out as far west as San Francisco, swinging
round by Denver and New Orleans and then
working his way northward again up to St.
Louis and Chicago and Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Remembering these things the idle young
&ldquo;flatty&rdquo; turned and looked at the green-coated
and sunken-shouldered figure, touched into
some rough pity by the wordless pathos of an
existence which seemed without aim or reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Batty, how long&rsquo;re yuh going to peddle
glue, anyway?&rdquo; he suddenly asked.</p>
<p>The glue-peddler, watching the crowds that
drifted by him, did not answer. He did not
even look about at his interrogator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo; yuh <i>have</i> to do this?&rdquo; asked the wide-shouldered
youth in uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the peddler&rsquo;s mild yet guttural
response.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>The other prodded with his night-stick
against the capacious overcoat pockets. Then
he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet yuh&rsquo;ve got about forty dollars
stowed away in there,&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;Yuh
have now, haven&rsquo;t yuh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo; know!&rdquo; listlessly answered the
sunken-shouldered figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;re yuh sellin&rsquo; this stuff for, if
it ain&rsquo;t for money?&rdquo; persisted the vaguely
piqued youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo; know!&rdquo; was the apathetic answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who does?&rdquo; inquired the indolent
young officer, as he stood humming and rocking
on his heels and swinging his stick by its
wrist-thong.</p>
<p>The man known as Batty may or may not
have been about to answer him. His lips
moved, but no sound came from them. His
attention, apparently, was suddenly directed
elsewhere. For approaching him from the
east his eyes had made out the familiar figure
of old McCooey, the oldest plain-clothes man
who still came out from Headquarters to
&ldquo;pound the pavement.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>And at almost the same time, approaching
him from the west, he had caught sight of another
figure.</p>
<p>It was that of a dapper and thin-faced man
who might have been anywhere from forty to
sixty years of age. He walked, however, with
a quick and nervous step. Yet the most remarkable
thing about him seemed to be his
eyes. They were wide-set and protuberant,
like a bird&rsquo;s, as though years of being hunted
had equipped him with the animal-like faculty
of determining without actually looking back
just who might be following him.</p>
<p>Those alert and wide-set eyes, in fact, must
have sighted McCooey at the same time that
he fell under the vision of the old cement
seller. For the dapper figure wheeled quietly
and quickly about and stooped down at the
very side of the humming patrolman. He
stooped and examined one of the peddler&rsquo;s
many-fractured china plates. He squinted
down at it as though it were a thing of intense
interest to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>As he stooped there the humming patrolman
was the witness of a remarkable and inexplicable
occurrence. From the throat of the huge-shouldered
peddler, not two paces away from
him, he heard come a hoarse and brutish cry,
a cry strangely like the bawl and groan of a
branded range-cow. At the same moment the
gigantic green-draped figure exploded into
sudden activity. He seemed to catapult out
at the stooping dapper figure, bearing it to the
sidewalk with the sheer weight of his unprovoked
assault.</p>
<p>There the struggle continued. There the
two strangely diverse bodies twisted and
panted and writhed. There the startlingly
agile dapper figure struggled to throw off his
captor. The arch of gas-pipe went over.
Glue-bottles showered amid the shattered
glass and crockery. But that once placid-eyed
old cement seller stuck to the unoffending
man he had so promptly and so gratuitously
attacked, stuck to him as though he had
been glued there with his own cement. And
before the patrolman could tug the combatants
apart, or even wedge an arm into the fight,
the exulting green-coated figure had his
enemy on his back along the curb, and, reaching
down into his capacious pocket, drew out
two oddly shaped steel wristlets. Forcing up
his captive&rsquo;s arm, he promptly snapped one
steel wring on his own wrist, and one on the
wrist of the still prostrate man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re yuh tryin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo; demanded the
amazed officer, still tugging at the great figure
holding down the smaller man. In the encounter
between those two embattled enemies
had lurked an intensity of passion which he
could not understand, which seemed strangely
akin to insanity itself.</p>
<p>It was only when McCooey pushed his way
in through the crowd and put a hand on his
shoulder that the old cement seller slowly rose
to his feet. He was still panting and blowing.
But as he lifted his face up to the sky
his body rumbled with a Jove-like sound that
was not altogether a cough of lungs overtaxed
nor altogether a laugh of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got him!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</div>
<p>About his once placid old eyes, which the
hardened tear-ducts no longer seemed able to
drain of their moisture, was a look of exultation
that made the gathering street-crowd take
him for a panhandler gone mad with hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh got <i>who</i>?&rdquo; cried the indignant young
officer, wheeling the bigger man about on his
feet. As the cement seller, responding to that
tug, pivoted about, it was noticeable that the
man to whom his wrist was locked by the band
of steel duly duplicated the movement. He
moved when the other moved; he drew aside
when the other drew aside, as though they were
now two parts of one organism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got him!&rdquo; calmly repeated the old street-peddler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh got <i>who</i>?&rdquo; demanded the still puzzled
young patrolman, oblivious of the quiescent
light in the bewildered eyes of McCooey, close
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Binhart!&rdquo; answered Never-Fail Blake,
with a sob. &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve got Binhart!</i>&rdquo;</p>
